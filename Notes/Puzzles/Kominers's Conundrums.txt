Spamming with numbers is banned thus first order is the expected bimodal distribution and guesstimating underlying spread on entries. Second order is trying to pick a value others do not to maximize win probability thus 6969 if I win they might publish it eternally in the public written record. Should have submitted 6969.4205318008 to have BOOBIES in Bloomberg next to Lazar Ilic eternally in the public written record would have been very attractive and classy...
