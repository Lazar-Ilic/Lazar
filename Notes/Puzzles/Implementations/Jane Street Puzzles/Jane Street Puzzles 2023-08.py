# So 10 minutes in to the round I think this code is pretty OK looks visually good to me uh robust enough ternary search I would not say I have any intuition here but their .pdf file now suggests considering uh casework if possible and the D<=1 case here is relevant and should potentially reveal the answer uh. One would think that their solution their can be modified with https://mathworld.wolfram.com/SpherePointPicking.html like a weighted 2-angle spherical coordinate conversion. And potentially again just a 8 symmetry maybe uh assuming positive positive positive directional so like 1 angle is random in [0,pi/2] and the elevation angle is weighted random in [0,pi/2] as well but weighted uh. So uh the weight here should be like cos[x] or whatever and then to convert back in to raw coordinates I think we could just do it like in that other Jane round solution uh the height is like direct sin[x] or whatever and then uh the other uh would be cos[x]cos[y] and cos[x]cos[y] or whatever uh... so all of these integrals I think would be like uh... how to weight uh... uh uh uh but summing up Probabilities no that is not quite right uh uh uh... so A + B + C + 2D + 2E + 2F + 3G is like expected number of crosses uh uh uh and computing G might be uh trivial uh... and computing uh D might also be easy uh I mean computing uh something like uh... D + G or whatever uh... and then subtracting off D to find P of that pure D yadda... OK so let us uh try it out and see if we can generate that optimal value here 1st try ugh... so it is like ugh uh... G = integral from 0 to pi/2 of integral from 0 to pi/2 of (2/pi)*cos(x)*sin(x)*cos(x)*cos(y)*cos(x)*sin(y) dx dy = D^3/(4pi) OK and uh then uh D is like check here oh should be E F too uh... with the G should be like uh D^2*2/(3pi) OK and then that means each of those is like uh so uh that was uh what (D+G) and uh we want 6D + 3G so multiply by 6 and subtract 3G works uh... 4*D^2/(pi)-3*D^3/(4*pi)... and subtract that off of the uh... is like 3/2 is the whole thing uh... so 3*D/2-4*D^2/(pi)+3*D^3/(4*pi)... gives uh (0.7452572091,0.5095346021)
