OK see if I need to go to bed here tonight but like note that uh maybe it requires uh like 15 squares inside and uh 17 area outside uh uh uh unclear uh maybe consider uh for each uh convex hull created from the uh diagonals we have to like consider how many ways to shape them so that half are outie half are innie is like 1 trick so that we need uh area 32 bounded by uh diagonals I think uh and casework on number of diagonals... is like if we were to uh rotate by 45 I think and uh needed an area there of like uh 16 uh on the new underlying uh line segments of true length sqrt[2] in this have length uh 1...

Uh so OKOKOK in this case we need I think there is an underlying grid we can capture and is maxed out at 18 so like we need to keep it uh closed and not capture 2 of these grid boxes and then some of those have different number of edges so like count up each case number of edges and uh multiply by the relevant [2a choose a] multiplicities I think...

And uh it is like uh 2 times that I think rotational works here so uh... we can manually try uh like 18 choose 2 cases I think... OKOKOK I think I can bash uh like...

10 exterior dudes should be like 10 choose 2 ensured to uh work... is 45 there and then uh another like... 14 uh but 2 really unique cases there is like uh... 4 of those do not work is like 10 valid there I think 55 valid overall... 1 + 16 + 2 is like uh 19 45 leaves uh 26 left...

2*[[8]*[24 choose 12]+[2+26]*[22 choose 11]+[16+2]*[20 choose 10]+[1]*[18 choose 9]]
