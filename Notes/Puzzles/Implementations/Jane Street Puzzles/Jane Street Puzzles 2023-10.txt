A Weird Tour
My journey across this bizarre planet is complete, even though I only visited 11 of the 120 regions with their strange gradually shifting dialects. Over the trip I swapped ends of the planet using a variety of methods of transport between each destination. Below are some clues to the names of the regions I visited for all but the fifth... maybe you can help me fill in my itinerary with the name of that strange fifth country?

I started in

1. Unserious

Then I took a plane to

2. Social (1,6,8)

I took a tour to get to

3. Learning about (3 words) (8,9)

Then switched to a big bus to make it to

4. Weakness

Then a subway got me to

5. ???

From there I walked through a tunnel to arrive at

6. Game series (2 words) (4)

A long train ride got me to

7. Superstar artist (2 words) (1)

Then I hopped on a boat to

8. Sign of doubt (2 words) (3)

I rode a bike to

9. Exec (11)

Then a friendly horse carried me on to

10. Suddenly emote (3 words) (11)

Finally, a limo drove me to my ultimate stop:

11. South Asian (9,12)

----------

Kind of reminded me of Jane Street Puzzles - Pair Dance 2. And their Tit For Tat. So I reread the flavour text thinking of character string based mechanisms. Swapped ends suggests perhaps palindrome or North|South pole duality. Later, I cracked it.
