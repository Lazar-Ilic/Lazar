I am not on a script [simple enough according to Geeks For Geeks [Python Script To Monitour Website Changes] and others] or RSS Really Simple Syndication notification system. Winning 1st Solver is tricky as release times are unstable. Most IBM Ponder This and Jane Street Puzzles are significantly easier to me than tricky Project Leonhard Euler or 3200-rated AtCoder|CodeForces tasks. I suggest avoiding an IBM Ponder This and Jane Street Puzzles habit. The lack of prize money and attention from elite puzzlers further makes it unappealing. Elite research mathematicians might [not according to Logan Seaburg's LinkedIn post which emphasised some of the same points] enjoy taking Project Euler seriously to a 25 Out Of 25 award wholly on the leaderboards, which could be notated on a Resume as "25 Leaderboards In A Row". This accomplishment is especially impressive the longer it lasts and the more "100%" and high "Difficulty" tasks it includes. Project Euler at this level is still not even that impressive really, it is just aighty in the zone with ~USAMO and Putnam rank 20th. One way to deal with trolly Project Euler administrators is to simply comment in thread and continue suggesting one's privately recorded solves imply problem solving ability.

If they run more puzzles with a few solutions rather than the meta of 1 unique solution, then one can not programatically prune out 2 paths just because they had the same intermediate position - in this case there are other configurational issues, see my post round commentary in that section near the top of my template az() function.

I tried solving the more general system using more sophisticated techniques involving polynomials, Taylor... other series, and SymPy practise. "More general" here say for the maximum number of 1s being 10^9 or something much larger than 10. For 10 I would have opted to do this competitive programming style with Python Decimal as follows:

from decimal import Decimal
from decimal import getcontext
ctx=getcontext()
print(ctx)
ctx.prec=1000
def solve(maxones, prob):
	l=Decimal("0")
	r=Decimal("1")
	while l<r and (l+r)/2!=l and (l+r)/2!=r:
		m=(l+r)/2
		a=2-1/m
		for b in range(maxones):
			a=(2*m-1+(4*(a-1)*(a-1)*m*m-4*(a-1)*(a-1)*m+1).sqrt())/(2*m)
		if a<prob:
			l=m
		else:
			r=m
	return l

Chatted afterwards with another fast solver on LinkedIn. The 3087 was a nearly OnSighted logical force and from there I deduced quite a lot in conjunction with the heuristic that introducing less mirrors to complete large values could be useful. So e.g. there was some point where I saw 2025 would finish with 1 mirror added directly next to it reflecting it to the right. I was in a position where the 48 would not work out so I went back through again eyeballing what looked most right and trying to complete the 48 and 112 reasonably. I am fairly confident this one can be cracked in under 15 minutes maybe 10 by an elite puzzler. Hall Of Mirrors is one of Kraftwerk's worst pieces but the lyrics are funny. I posted up a screenshot of my erroneous partial progress with 4 squares of differences in the corresponding file. And also ought to note more formally that distinct numbers must lie on distinct paths so the observation about degrees of freedom and introducing a low number of mirrors is kinda forced.

Worth mentioning that the most obvious way to prove there is no solution with a greater GCD is to exhaustively search as I did. Also, 9! = 362880 which suggests checking down to ~1000 might be trivial under the ~ that the density of rows congruent to 0 modulo case is ~ 1/case and even checking if a solution exists for ~500 rows is very fast.

The 38, 19, and 11 were all important and a key insight in puzzles like this with a single right answer is that the solution is probably ~unique which can help rule out potential configurations. This round is certainly solvable in under 1 hour with a sharp OnSight of those fences.

Initial ideas: different coloured squares have different mirror properties e.g. some are normal mirrors, others are rotated 90 degrees prior to functioning as normal mirrors, and others do nothing. Hoping for interesting English strings to appear in the LASER tracings or regions, region areas, etc. Also consider simplifying and considering the 3 colours cases separately inducing subgraphs. Observing the natural near Hamiltonian Path is not quite translatable via Betamaze e.g. perhaps with colours and more review of Puzzle Hunt corpus I would have gotten this one.

"I n to the n equals a to the b." n^n = a^b. Number of integer solutions. So either 2023 is the number of divisors in the ultimate odd exponent or the number of divisors of n + the number of divisors of n/2 in the ultimate even exponent. 2023 = 7 * 17^2 leads to configurations such as 3^16 * 5^16 * 7^6 some of which may be lower in preultimate representation but only by at most a factor of ~2023. For a case like 2^a * 3^b * 5^c one would have [a+1]*[b+1]*[c+1] and then [a]*[b+1]*[c+1] for [2a+1]*[b+1]*[c+1] so 2^59 * 3^16 = 24814745171855578232782848 works ~2.48E25 or 2^144 * 3^6 or 2^1011 or 2^8 * 3^16 * 5^6 for example. But that final example can not be made to work and in fact something more like rigourous mechanistic checking leads to 2^2 * 3^16 * 5^16 would lead to [[2^1 * 3^8 * 5^8] ^ 2] ^ [2^2 * 3^16 * 5^16] = [2^1 * 3^8 * 5^8] ^ [2^3 * 3^16 * 5^16] in ultimate representation so 26273633422851562500.

Unofficial 1st Solver #3 with screenshot capture due to Wrong Answer initial submission verdict in the finalised ranking. Note firstly that it suffices to count up the number of capturing regions with diagonals and then multiply by the relevant [2a choose a] factor for exterior interior quarter-circle selection. From there, rotating by 45 degrees and considering a binary base 2 White And Black parity argumentation one deduces that it suffices to count up the number of ways to enclose the maximal area ~18 region in the new coordinates with a simple closed curve which reduces to analysing how to remove 2 of the potential viable grid squares from the 18-block leaving a simple viable closed curve. So there are 10 exterior squares, 6 interior squares, and 2 very-interior squares which are ensured to remain connected so it then follows we need to count up the perimeters on the [10 choose 2] = 45 viable exterior pair removals as well as the 2*3+4*2=14 potential viable exterior-interior pairs except we then note that 4 of those do not work as they cut off and separate an exterior square so there are only 10 which do work.

Onsight gaze upon the task statement and imagine the optimal construction and numerical answer. One could manipulate via physical or digital pentagons. Note that there are 2 unique positions with respect to rotation e.g. the initial pentagon in the chain and its reflection. Simply bashing potential chains works with respect to the 5 relevant directions and canceling 0s cancels initially. Or one can try to generate plausible potential minima via merely examining potential offsets and then producing a valid accepted corresponding chain.

First need the Expected Value for the hyperbolic soccer ball. Oh not hyperbolic it is an actual soccer ball OK well then this is a simple Markov Chain on the layer of the ball matrix inversion system of linear equations for the soccer ball case.

A = 1 + B
B = 1 + [2/3]*C
C = 1 + [1/3]*B + [1/3]*C + [1/3]*D
D = 1 + [1/3]*C + [1/3]*D + [1/3]*E
E = 1 + [2/3]*D + [1/3]*F
F = 1 + E

For WolframAlpha:

A=1+B, B=1+[2/3]*C, C=1+[1/3]*B+[1/3]*C+[1/3]*D, D=1+[1/3]*C+[1/3]*D+[1/3]*E, E=1+[2/3]*D+[1/3]*F, F=1+E

Gives:

A = 20
B = 19
C = 27
D = 32
E = 34

A few key ideas were ruling out squares like this 3 here means these nearby dudes cannot be 3s, sometimes eying a square in particular and being like this dude cannot be a 1, 2, 4, or 5, therefore it must be a 3, deductions based around like if this dude is an 8 then a contradiction emerges as it blocks all viables 8s over in that other block, a couple depth 2 type deductions and inferences as well.

The key is that for each sub strategy the probability of winning from that strategy must be 1/3 because that is the overall winning probability and in the Nash Equilibrium we are getting equal odds on all sub strategies or else it would make sense and we would be incentivised to shift probability mass around from one strategy to another. But upon the observation that we either do that given strategy or a smoothing argument to an 8 wide strategy [one in which positive >0 fuel is allocated to each of the 8 races] it then becomes clear.

Compute P of winning from 8 wide state actually... by noting that for a random instance of such a dude and adding up over all of the cases in the Probability Mass Function for when there were only 0s in that race... otherwise a contradiction emerges as there would be a 1 dude already out contradiction as all of the 8 wide dudes must win a race prior to a 1 dude winning off of a 0 entry.

Due to isomorphism with a uniform random partial permutation ordering.

The sum in each region is [1*1+2*2+...+9*9]/19 = [9*10*19/6]/19 = 15. Perimeter insight forces yet again 9 6 Ls and 8 7 Ls pairing and there are 17 regions capturing the 17 9s and 8s which cannot go into the same region. The deduction is that indeed 9 L and 8 L must be opposite inducing the central sub 7x7 and then again voila the 7 L and 6 L must be opposite inducing the central sub 5x5. For there exist these 2 central regions. As there are 6 interior blocks in the 5x5 we deduce that each of the 19-6=13 7 and 6s must be in completed external pairs. Which forces interior blocks in the 8 7 Ls layer to be unfilled. I personally use the paint bucket right click function to fill with black throughout as well as thick black and red line drawing. This is because one ought to use a paint application as a part of serious performant Jane puzzles setup theory and praxis. Now this means that there is 1 surplus unpaired 8 to hit an interior block. This implies that in particular the bottom row having 2 interior blocks must be a part of the 9 6 Ls and then in particular it must be that they are both pinned in the bottom right corner as otherwise the 3 surplus 9s would be forced and the bottom right yellow square would be forced 8 7 which positionally violates the no 2x2 rule with the 2x1 blue. The bottom purple must be a 9 5 1 partition which then forces frankly all the 8s and 7s fall and nearly all the 9s and 6s too on connectedness. There may exist many outs at this point to proceed including brute force casework bashing but the 4 in fact forces its 2 neighbours to also be in the 4 L and hence also the 1 must be surrounded by the 2 L. But then it must be to the upper right of the 1 degenerate L. Now the 2s and 3s resolve to force the triple 5 5 5 in the upper left and the interior nearly resolves with connectedness pushing the 6.

One can compute the number of ways each maximum can occur for each partridge index and induct from the [1,2,...,n] case to the [1,2,...,[n+1]] case by precomputing the relevant binomial coefficients and then adding the multiplicity multiplied by the relevant one into the next row.

Python gave the following explicit solution:

Another simpler way is to convolve the relevant generating functions. This gives the number of ways to choose sets to the left and right of the partridge for each partridge index if all dudes are distinct e.g. for a maximum of 3 we multiply in code [1+2x+x^2][1+3x+3x^2+x^3][1+4x+6x^2+4x^3][1+5x+10x^2+10x^3]... and then further multiply out by the relevant factorials for arranging these 2 subsets with a b![77-b]! term prior to adding to our answer multiplied with the relevant maximum actual value term.

Mathematically one can reduce the search space a little and compute and store multiplicities via binomial coefficients. Firstly note there are [[25] choose [5,5,5,5,5]] relevant orderings. By symmetry it suffices to count 5!=120 multiplied by the number of ways for the first child to get more of the first candy, the second the second, etc. Note that the multiplicities and relevant partitions of 5 are:

5/1   5
20/4  4 1
20/4  3 2
30/6  3 1 1
20/4  2 1 1 1

Now one can compute the multiplicity of relevant suborderings inductively where the relevant information to store is the number of candies in each partition/bucket since that will uniquely determine the number of ways to insert candies in the future. For example after round 1:

M[5][0][0][0][0]=1
M[4][1][0][0][0]=25
M[4][0][1][0][0]=25
...

After round 2 though:

M[5][5][0][0][0]=126

OK been a long time since I did a Kenken I used to do these at Caltech think maybe even a kid who killed himself there was or knew the authors of that puzzle column in the student newspaper. And anyways I often did not invoke a rule I ought to have for deductions doing like easy onsightable 4x4s and 6x6s with some other insights. Anyways so I invert colours in JSPaint and let's see here. OK so it is the case that the only blocks with >2 rows are + and * which makes sense so the other operations are binary executions. The 59049* jumps out as 729*81*1 fails as does 729*27*3 so it must be 243 and 81*3 fails so it must be 243*27*9. Now this means the 392*5 is ruled out and thus the 1960* must be 245*8. This means that 21/1 42/2 84/4 ruled out so the 21/ must be 63/3. Now we have 1 7 8 9 remaining and the 1 forced right so to get 13/ it must be 78/6 leaving 19-2 for the 17-. This forces 4*264 for the 1056* as we must leave either 2-1 or 5-4 or 6-5 for the 1- and note that the 969* must lead with a 1 or 5. 17*57 or 19*51. The 6-5 for the 1- is now forced leaving the 1 5 pinned in the 969*. Now the other number in the 5/ must lead with a 1 forcing 17*57 for the 969*. This forces 945/189 for the 5/. Note leading 9 in the 1009+ is forced. Parity at this point means 1 8 are deduced their on ends leaving 3 5 9 now to get a 6 in the units digit forces 69-3 for the 66-. This forces the 5 at the end which then forces the 4 at the end in the 1- and then 15-14 is forced because we need 3+7=10 for the 1009+ quantity. The 42/2 for the 21/ falls. Now 57 is forced in the 342* leaving 6 at the end of the 17/. Now actually the units digit in the 63+ is forced ends to be 6 and 7 as all others fail. And this then forces 47+16 for the 63+. Now the 3 and 2 are pinned in the 342*. This resolves 81/9 for the 9/ and an end 8. Units digit then in the 22- is forced 5 to leave 3+6 for the 57+ so 25-3 for the 22- thus 8+43+6 for the 57+. 136/8 for the 17/ falls leaving 78+31 to finish in the 1009+. No Easter egg here. 4282. This writeup could have been done in new line logical deduction notation I suppose I could do that for future such rounds.

I can precisify a little here and comment that yes in terms of a little fun onsighting and ad hoc de novo this puzzle can be solved in like 5 minutes by a sharp puzzler and so one could observe that especially if it was captured. And be wowed or not really. It makes one think whoop dee whoop I really am the high functioning, caffeine using, Sherlock Holmes of the deductions in my logicking.

OK. Seems doable given my history with knights moving.

Right I thought of both the Markov process as well as the expected number of days missed being 0.5 actually which leads to an upper bound of 2403 actually 365[364/365]^n=0.5 so that is OK on top of their lower bound. Now this can be approximated off the dome with the Taylor series for logarithm [lowkey joking] log[1+x]. Simulations work because this is a binary variable if you execute 10000000 simulations and the underlying p~1/2 then the variance is npq so standard deviation of 10000/2=5000 means even if p~0.5005 then it is aced so simulations work here.

However, if one has an upper bound of n then in general one can multiply the relevant generating functions in O[n^2 * log[n]] using convolution, truncating terms above x^n as needed and then summing coefficients until clearing the threshold value. In this particular case each step is an exponential/geometric discrete distribution on support [1,2,3,...] and thus for example the generating function is given by [[362/365],[1-362/365][362/365],...] which is px/[1-[1-p]x] and thus product from 1 to 365 of [n/365]*x/[1-[1-n/365]*x] is the generating function and one could sum these coefficients until clearing the 0.5 threshold value at the x^j term where j is the desired value using computer algebra software for example. And furthermore in an online setting with some uncertainty but a known inequality one can optimally truncate terms as deduced.

Colours, underlines, actual actors... interesting interesting interesting stuff they should make Jane harder again harder and harder. I can't actually mock the libidinal energy and lust for win lust for rank 1 lust for low latency and lust for the solve.

Onsight Wright brothers I mean but really FOUNTAIN MINERAL FEMININE COOK ASK GRIP I can't be quite sure. Very interesting think in round with the hint I would have aced. I think so I think in this time period games such as applications like the jewel one were very popping and popular with such gravity based turn based puzzley mechanisms.

Methinks of the canonical fact that there exist 2 such tetrahedra and then state based dynamic program from the bottom upwards ought to work.

Starting to struggle to care might hop back in this commentary mix I mean the earliest ones were very surprisingly interesting I don't know if these more pure logicky ones are or are not lame.

Long. Journey. To me the title suggests that one solve for 6 integers I can't be quite sure what the long journey is about.

Pretty boring puzzle but BitcoinsAreAmazing is an interesting name [just kidding] for parents to give their child circa 2000, rather prescient. I personally think that the Jane firm should force realish names and somehow cut the spams submissions.

There do not exist that many 7ominoes and for each one it is easy to brute force casework each possible orientation and position and then compute the maximum number of mutually exclusive in a set such as the depicted one so one could code this up and produce the other set.

It would appear that Scott Duke Kominers made a reference to the title of this one. Also Tit For Tat was similar in some ways and perhaps I ought to note patterns in their T T textual experiences so I will be sure to not miss the next one!

https://www.janestreet.com/puzzles/deck-the-cards-index/

I gonna bona fide this one so one read of the title is that deck the cards is a command to the puzzler so are there patterns here and what sorting might do I mean translate to numbers or look at permutations and suits and ranks. Maybe colours to binary even. Interesting.

I think in C++ a brute force with mild pruning is fast.

I guess that the standard back upsolve analysis here would be to Google the title. I think it would have fallen from there with an engine.

So the sum of all elements gives density expected value of element argumentation to deduce sum of cubes and overall sense for density pushing 5x5 and 4x4 maybe followed by natural each row being a sum of squares perhaps with some modulo argumentations.

I don't like this one or any word list program puzzles. I frankly have 0 interest in them.

Some of the sums are very large and some very small and those enable severe deductions.

I don't know how to do this one really computationally I mean eyeball guessing and then hoping to minimise error from there.

Note that the text file formatting suggests raw text is what is relevant, not browser specific structural appearance. Insofar as I can discern, there exist a number of firms that compare puzzling with their work in writing on their websites so... maybe one day one of them gives me a job offer so I can quantitatively puzzle with them. In terms of puzzles manifesto or whatever I mean these can be pretty good fun ad hoc de novo forces but frankly Project Euler is the king crown jewel and to be Eulerian Rank 1 would be a potential major major major life milestone. These are frankly mostly pretty midbrow, some are textbook exercises, some are tricky textbook exercises, and some rise slightly beyond.
