Ugh maybe I should comment. I dunno I read multiple MS Master Of Science theses from MassTech and Harvard. A lot of them were weak. Sam Korsky, 2 Sigma quantitative researcher who once I think ate Chipotle with me in Cambridge, wrote a pretty mediocre one. I thought Ellen Yuexin Li of Citadel Securities and Emily Jia as well both just wrote down awful ones. I am still under the impression that Valerie Zhang of the Virtu firm is a totally moronic 0|10 writer who will never even begin to fathom how to comprehend The Half let alone The Whole or whatever. My perception is that Patrick Guo actually of the Citadel Securities firm did some solid meritorious pure mathematics and e.g. Binwei Yan's was OK. I dunno how impressive Peng's PhD thesis really even was really hard for me to tell but recently I spoke with a recruiter who said to aim for NeurIPS and a 4.00 GPA Grade Point Average during an elite PhD in Statistics if possible as well.
