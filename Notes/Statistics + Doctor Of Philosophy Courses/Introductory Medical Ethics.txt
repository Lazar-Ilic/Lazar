Interesting topic... maybe I ought to sketch up some notes if I were to teach high schoolers in a short course on the topic...

----------

Lecture 1

Could introduce different principles.

Hippocratic Oath

Do not lie to the patient.

Stronger forms like: I will attempt to honestly maximise the patient's health and not my own profit net loss.

Note 2025-08 after studying more hacking. Defend other practitioners who do not aspire to rise to that level. The thing is this can easily go in to severely serious zones of optimisations some would not really... evidently Peter Attia and Lazar Ilic have both maybe had wack intuitions about the physics of various settings and this easily goes in to experiments people might think are positive in expected value but still fairly risky. I still basically think wannabes ought to read more articles like "Why I'd never take the hair loss drug President Trump uses" by Bruce Horovitz and shit like obviously would seem to me like pure iatrogenic ideology.

----------

An odd example: say the patient enquires about 200mg oral ibuprofen.

A wannabe clever answer might include a conditional where if the patient made an unwise decision, they ought to simply take the pain and suffering to learn the lesson. But if they instead got unlucky.

----------

Utilitarianism

Vague metrics? Intuition? Measuring preferences.

----------

Ugh I am so bad at this should probably focus on mathematics research rather than this document ugh... I have annoying offensive toy examples any wannabe could walk through.

----------

Principles And Maxims

Iatrogenesis

General Toxicity

Very Toxic Toxins

Minimalism

Negative Expected Value Interacting Terms - Polypharmacy

Simulated Patient Encounters On Hormonal Contraception, Female Sex Toys, ...

...

----------

Upon further review like if some female patient did ask about female sex toys one could mention they might feel good but some men would be annoyed and especially annoyed if the female later complains about a lack of ability to orgasm from vanila penis in vagina sexual intercourse or whatever... the male might be very very annoyed and think the female is a moron with a lack of a grasp on developmental neurology or whatever. But they can go ahead and do it anyways if they want to.

----------

I might need to come back to this later to be quite honest I was reviewing the Aly Cohen versus Andrea Love debate on chemophobia and principles of precaution vis a vis the US EPA United States Environmental Protection Agency and the EWG Environmental Working Group.

Both had pretty awful moments in that debate. Sometimes Aly Cohen representing the EWG came across as kind of cranky and whiny depending on who you even ask in the MCS Multiple Chemical Sensitivity scene.

But Andrea Love had multiple opportunities to chime in and agree with Aly and failed to do so. For example, she would have appeared more friendly and prosocial on the issue of phthalates and male genitalia by agreeing right there on the spot. Because that literature is kinda damning to be quite honest.

----------

I am fairly confident that Doctor Mike sometimes chimes in with a... recall from medical school... or like recall from UWorld some kinda content even casuals might know about so like... defining toxin can immediately come in to the gas Carbon Monoxide or whatever discuss some odourless or nearly odourless nerve gases which can kill quite rapidly and nevertheless are why we want instruments on air. Because human intuitions surrounding odours, malodours, and chemicals can be quite numerically wrong quite often. Humans are not rational.

----------

In terms of me "coming to terms" with Andrea Love oh I think she is en pointe in some parts like we still have disputes about cancer I personally know my 0g fibre diet is a risk for real but still disputes intellectually over the merits of moving from 10g|day to 40g like fairly confident the average Jap' eats like 10g per day or whatever dunno why people think dietary fibre is a miracle or health metric or whatever.

----------

So anyways I am with multiple commenters here thought Andrea was kinda obnoxious and egotistical in multiple spots but still Cohen is a bit 'noided.

----------

So anyways back to enumerating some classical health metrics like we could walk through a standardish kinda general practise blood laboratory work but... would imagine:

Does The Patient Respond Yes Rather Than No When Queried: Is Your Life Worth Living?

Is itself more important than rating scales from dysphoria to euphoria or something.

Blood Pressure
Fasting Serum Glucose
Heart Rate
5K Run Time
Able To Lift 5 Repetitions Of 135lb On Overhead Press
DEXA Body Fat
...
Dietary Fibre Intake

But the point I want to stress is that usually when asked why fibre is good people will say eating fibre is healthful because it causes better glucose metrics even though for many people like myself this is simply false. So they would need to point at cancer risk reduction via some pathways related to the clearance of "toxins" from the body.

----------

Were I in the mixture I would certainly opt to chime in opine with Mike and Andrea on the issue of organic foods however like for sure 1 hunnid percent this is about advising patients on reasonable allocations of capital and I would think rich doctors blowing money fast on organics is kinda annoying and spammy bruvvv.

Andrea's writing criticising Aly on some pesticides is aighty. Now if I had to critique the Maximus firm on hCG by the way I would say firstly in their article on this topic it is not common but rather not uncommon but that is a digression. The primary point here is that the nausea is not caused by E2 it is actually caused via some other pathway or more directly via hCG. And I am still not even really following the claim that hCG is a much more potent aromatase inducer than testosteron directly. So anyways I feel that when Andrea reads a Tweet on the issue of fragrances and odours more generally and fails to chime in in line with the EPA that VOCs are sus' she is doing a real disservice to her viewership. Also it is true that some of these "chemicals" do not bind to E receptors with strong agonism but nevertheless she severely underestimates the general oestrogenicity of a lot of modern "toxins" which are mediated via simply inducing aromatase in modern humans and elevating their actual serum E2. So when she points at some graph showing how some of these chemicals are themselves 1000x weaker than E2 she still misses that stuff like lavender flowers can increase E2 in males severely and is thus a "toxin" in an at least mid-key way.

Cohen actually said that factual accuracy is ‚Äúin the eye of the beholder‚Äù

That should tell you everything you need to know.

Just enjoy the interview for the joy of watching Dr Andrea Love call out the pseudo science while simultaneously fighting off a bullshit induced stroke.

She almost induced a stroke in me, herself. Statements like "Cochineal dye is more allergenistic than red 40" (so what?), "PFAS is fine, you just pee it out" and "Americans are too dumb to be trusted with health data" are crazy-making. It seems like she sees herself as a woman at war with pseudoscience, so everything Dr. Cohen says automatically get filed under "pseudoscience" and she tries to refute it, whether it's true or false.

Not that Cohen was any better, and she sucks at communicating, as well. I wish they could vocalise their agreement on some points, before focusing on the ones they disagree - for example, Cohen brought up anti-microbial compound overuse - does she have a point? Dr. Love never disagreed, and I heard that point from others, so it seems like they agree, but why not start your argument with "I agree on this and that, but here is what I disagree with". Instead, it seems like Love saw herself as this Great Debunker, and didn't want to "lend any credibility" to Cohen üôÑüôÑ

I love the passionate vibe, they both truly care about their cause. But is natural always good and chemicals always bad? Of course not.

What a smug person, this, dr. love. Data is not released because only 28% of USA is scientifically literate. WTF?

Constantly uses nature fallacy trope as a bad thing and at the same time constantly uses Appeal to Authority Fallacy as a good thing. But that authority wont release RAW data, not with chemicals and not with vaccines.

Judge scraps 75-year FDA timeline to release Pfizer vaccine safety data, giving agency eight months

Pfizer dont want to release RAW data even to scientist. Why not? But we have to trust the authorities.

Person can be accurate and not smug. She is smug and because she is smug, she, wouldn't even aknowladge that she is inaccurate. And for you to not realise that she is smug is demonstrating how good appeal to authority on majority of people really works.

Do you remember a saying that was used for consumers to disregard online privacy? If you have nothing to hide why hide it. Same goes for all the data that is hidden from consumers. You have no answer why they hide data?

I just skimmed through the video. I couldn't watch much because of Dr. Love's constant passive aggressiveness. She seemed to bring so much hate and frustration to the debate which is not helpful. One doesn't need to constantly berate the other person and make unnecessary annoying facial expressions to prove their points. I don't know either of these people. Dr love could have proved dr Cohen wrong just with her words and facts without being disrespectful. Dr love should learn from Dr Mike actually. Dr Mike is always so respectful when arguing with someone. It's not that hard.

Maybe skim it again, cause dr Cohen threw in some smirks of her own too. So I would not hitch my horse to That carriage...
But! this "show me the data" attitude people endlessly complain about people arguing against them are "disrespectful" or put up a stern defense and not yield in the face of absolue dogwater claims or fabricated/bent information. So Maybe put up a better presenter for your cause, or bring arguments that stand up to scrutiny and not collapse the second someone asks for something more solid than "idk! anything could be harmful ig....".

Dr Cohen was woefully unpreparted for her book tour. She isnt comfortable in this kind of setting, where she has to balance her pitching her book in an organic way, having to follow and pivot in a freeflowing conversation, where yes, she was challanged by Dr Mike, and Dr Love too.
After a little while i would say at like 25 minutes into the conversation she fully lost the plot. Her usual ig ~10 min set ran out, and after that she was stranded and had to move very quickly from topic-to-topic, then later from buzzword-to-buzzword to avoid being pinned down on any one sticky topic that she couldnt get out from till the end of the interview.

She seemed to bring so much hate and frustration to the debate which is not helpful.

I Am Sorry! This is just concentrated cope, with a hint of sexism...

Dr Love spoke clearly (you know... depends on her current approach to science communication. or how much jargon, or what level or abstraction she wants to get at an explanation), and precisely about ...nvm, ima start over on a new line.

Dr Love spoke clearly and precisely about the topics that came up in this conversation. She never fell into using words incorrectly, or just stumbled into a flailing wordsalad of emotionally triggering phrases that are popular today.

On the other hand Dr Cohen used a number of underhanded rhetorical tactics that are emblematic of a salesman (sleazy or otherwise. in the health infulencer space in the process of breaking bad. Sleazy.) She exploited relateble sounding emotoinal stories over and over, to insinuate that the whole healthcare profession is just a whole heap of ossified heartless endevour from the basic education onwards. And only the brave renegade from the outside can liberate us from our shackels of deception... Laughable!
She Explicitly and Intentionally misunderstood/misrepresented the scientific method, and how we use it to analyse our world, and come up with solutions for our issues.*
This is such a colossal bad act, that it is disqualifying for a professional provider. A Despicable display of a corrupt person cashing in her remaining reputation in a polite society for a bit of money, and maybe a future lobbying gig.
Between the wordsalads, the often not knowing the meaning of the words she is using, and the casual flirting with actual pseudoscience and antivaxxer sentiments is just further proof of a person sliding into the alt-health, purely business-focused medicine practitioner evolution. Into the later parts of the interview, she just falls apart, nothing substantive happens there, she cicles back over and over again into almost verse-like rythmic mini-rants, and the show ends...

You are accusing Dr. Cohen of using buzz words while you also use buzz words. Pseudoscience and antivax, alt health, .... are buzz words.

Dr. Love asked Dr. Cohen why does she care about acces to safety data? Why do you care what Dr. Cohen says? What's the harm of doing 21 day detox recommended in the book? What does Dr. Cohen recommends that is doing harm?

You paint dr. Cohen as deplorable person and only in it for the money. What do you think of 11 of 16 people that after their jobs in the FDA got high paying jobs in companies that they were supposed to regulate? Is it possible they are also deplorable and motivated by money? If they are that much bigger problem than whatever dr. Cohen did.

As doctor Mike said regulatory agencies should be investigated.

1st!

Buzzwords are not any popular word at any given time. Neither words you dont like.

2nd!

She is presenting pseudoscientific ideas as if they hold up in an rigorous conversation, or just asserts many times recycled old, old talking points from quacks. She touched on antivaccine talking points, like insinuating an autisom link with some kind of exposure. Alt-health is this wildly corrupt vague space of lackadasical, or straight up vibes based "medicinal practice", where you are lucky if you came away with no effects to your health.

3rd!

The safety data accessibility part started with some company spraying some anti-fungal thing at Dr Cohens house. AND SHEs LOOKING AT THE FUCKING MSDS SHEET! (im actually watching back that part)

https://youtu.be/uf6W4f7ebZ4?t=7491

This is where she tells the story of how she processed that event. She says in the end, that the remaining 99.something % she has no visibility into. And blows it up into some ginormous almost conspiratorial(like a loophole) thing. It is such an outragous misrepresentation of that datasheet, that im almost speechless (ok... benefit of the doubt! I think she just misunderstood the ramifications of the fact that it says on the sheet that its a "proprietary blend").
That remaining 99% material is just filler material, solvent, oh!... Dr Love actually spells it out
timestamp for that: https://youtu.be/uf6W4f7ebZ4?t=7612

Then Dr Love arrives at the 28% science literacy you pointed at.
She answers Dr Mikes question with a really unfortunate phrasing. And I just want to express it again, how annoying this momentary blunder is.
Because it gave an opportunity for Dr Cohen to just jump in with a "why not?" with a righeous inflection... (whoops! im mixing up my timeline a bit, but should be fine still)

Unfortunate answer aside, ill try to fix it for you here. (And im 100% certain if you would ask her this question in another setting she or her cohost, or wherever this hypothetical takes place would give a very similar answer).
... at first thought it seemed pretty easy as a concept, but in the context of this conversation i may not be able to be quick-to-the-point with it.
The argument, that Dr Cohen brings up, that all this granular safety information should be incessantly provided and pushed into your face with every product or tool you use (in this conversation Cohen brought it in, in a sense, that its kept secret for some corrupt/careless reason) is most likely counterproductive. And Again! She Could Read The Safety Data to Her Fungicide! It is publicly available despite her insistence to the contrary. ...'think i wanted to say something else here, but its gone...mb

Juice cleanses...
those are so old idek what going on with them...
At best nothing happens, and you just drank a shit ton of sugar needlessly probably,
at worst, it can kinda fuck wiht your kidneys and liver... idk

whats the harm with doing a detox? again. useless. Puts some strain on your liver.
But! Her book is not just a talse of some harmless fun with fruits.
The fact, that she doesnt understand, that natural and synthetic compounds are not differ in the slightest is just an unforgivable offense for a person who make it through medschool. It tells me that she either isnt smart at all, or that she just wants to sell a cheap narrative to people who cannot possibly know that they are lied to)

On the Bueraucracy front, unfortunately i just dont dare to make definitive statements. In the US there is this uncomfortable government cozyness with business. My favorite (well... easiest example, that government clients are routinely called "customers", which is weird for a governent, right?)

And Of Course, those industry jobs are high paying(it is industry!). If you made it to the level of seniority, that you are prominent in any field, you can leverage that for that level of position. It doesnt immediately means naked corruption. (OK! Ajit Pai can go fuck himself till the end of days, but he is a special boy!)(he isnt).

Your last paragraph... like, dont take it as an insult, cause its just hopelessness taking over. But its just intelectually very lazy. It might as well be a copy pasta from some 2bit muckraking youtuber. Big, Very Big companies have it way too good, and can do enormous damage unimpeded. But the compounds they make are a huge majority of the time are founded on solid evidence(i would say all in the modern times, but you know... shit can happen). They are most likely to exploit some marketing, or general market related dynamic to make obscene amounts of money.(applies mostly to insurance anyway)(or some underlying supporting infrastructure service).

Almost forgot:

Dr Cohen is not "only in it for the money", and we cant what about her bad acts away with: Ooh, these 11 now pharma execs or something.
She is a bad person, because she lies to her patients, who put their trust in her expertise about the cause of their issues and the potential solutions to them, despite knowing better. And putting out just another heap of medical misinformation into the zeitgeist, that we are going to have to fight against for decades probably.

And Yes! She wants to take that bag!

Not a sexist. Not supporting dr Cohen or Dr love. I was particularly talking about how dr love was arguing. If she were a man, I would say the same thing. I praised dr mike because of the way he respectfully argues and there are plenty of men AND women like him. If dr Cohen used similar disrespectful tactics and I missed it (I don't need to skim again, I'm taking your word for it), I will say the same thing about Dr. Cohen that she doesn't need to be disrespectful to prove her points.

Not a sexist. "If she were a man, I would say the same thing."

What I wanted to say with that is, that it Radiates oldschool sexism. And I am not saying, that you view things like that every hour of every day, but it textbook sexism and a conventient way to ignore the words she is saying from then on without guilt.

If dr Cohen used similar disrespectful tactics and I missed it (I don't need to skim again, I'm taking your word for it), I will say the same thing about Dr. Cohen that she doesn't need to be disrespectful to prove her points.

But she didnt eyeroll away Dr Cohens abject misrepresentations, and bad argumentation. She Explained her objections in plain language mostly, and at multiple points rebutted Cohens insinuations with her first "paragraph" of speech when she got her turn.

Not supporting dr Cohen or Dr love.

This conversation was set up to have back and forth between two experts on the topic at hand. Namely Dr Cohens book and the assertions in it (Dr Cohen is only treated as an "expert" here, because its her book that is under scrutiny and she should be very knowledgable at least strictly about the contents of her book, but possibly having a competent conversation about the surrounding or tangentially related fields, or literature that she presumably familiarized herself with while writing the book).
(Sidenote: anybody is allowed to write a book, you dont Need to be right about anything in them really... )
Dr Love is an immunologist, and a microbiologist and a science communicator. She was there to challange outlandish claims and mindless alarmism about "synthetic" chemicals, and whatever else Dr Cohen claims in her book. Basically Dr Love is not on a book-tour.

The "not supporting neither of these two" is just... I am probably very tired of this cop out take. You heard two people speak for an extended period of time. They had an argument, and somebody operated almost entirely on vibes, and invoking vague threats lurking behind every corner and other natural medicine mainstays.
If those red flags (even setting aside the intentional misrepresentations of the scientific method) didnt raise during this conversation, im not sure how to get through my point, that Dr Cohen is just doing a phoned in book tour with no helpful information to offer.

this whole conversation between you and I can be a case study of how the world full of overt and covert sexism has oppressed and discriminated women so much that my comment to you come across as "oldschool sexist".

about your last para, it is not "The "not supporting neither of these two" is just... I am probably very tired of this cop out take.". i am not lying coz i dont need to. even if i get bullied or harassed online, this account is anonymous so i dont have to lie. i have never heard about these two women. i watch dr mike's channel from time to time, that video was on my feed and i tried to watch and i couldnt because of dr love's constant face making eye rolling. as i mentioned i skimmed so i didnt watch the video for extended period, therefore, i don't have much knowledge about who is saying what (also i am not aware of the topic being discussed). so its not the video content but the communication that i noticed and just mentioned that here. the only thing i talked about in my initial comment is that i coudnt watch it because of her way of speaking. if i could watch the video, if she were patient, most likely i would have supported her (Dr love's) ideas because i saw many comments saying she was presenting facts and dr cohen was just promoting her book and ideas, and also dr mike seems to be leaning more towards dr love compared to dr cohen, and i have cognitive trust on dr mike because he has consistently (the videos i have watched) delivered fact-checked information.

another thing is that it can be difficult to have constructive arguments via texts online. i could have communicated better if i were talking to someone about this in person. i promote and support respectful behaviors irrespective of gender (having said that, if someone is outright disrespectful to a person, that person has the right to reciprocate).

i understand from your comment that you are passionate about this topic and far more knowledgeable than i am. but try not to read between the lines please. everyone has some core values, one of my core value is respectful engagement and i didnt see that in Dr. love in this video (maybe Dr cohen was too careful to not show it or at least i didnt see it which is why i didnt make any remark on dr cohen). i am not talking about the content as i couldn't watch the video properly, im talking about the communication from my perspective based on my value.

lastly, i understand if you don't understand what i am saying because it is difficult (at least for me) to communicate via messages, but i gave my best shot. i wish i could tell you my demography and my profession, and you would understand how i got flabbergasted when you mentioned my comment reflects sexism or old school sexism.

os. yeah.... i put the sexism aspect of the comment into all my resoponses. But I dont mean it to be a focal point here.
Yes. you just did a tiny, itsy bitsy sexism. Its not the end of the world. It was just a vehicle to not listen to the pesky establishment-science-man when she challanges on its face wrong and tired, thousand times heard naturopath or whatever bs.

(...eehm, alright! i read past the first paragraph now.) (also you can do the kind of emphasising bar thing before sections with a "> and then the section you want to put there", just learned it lol)

my comment to you come across as "oldschool sexist".

yeah. with the oldschool i didnt mean it, as in overt and humiliating, its just in an actual conversation it would be a Slight! :P

i watch dr mike's channel from time to time, that video was on my feed and i tried to watch and i couldnt because of dr love's constant face making eye rolling. as i mentioned i skimmed so i didnt watch the video for extended period, therefore, i don't have much knowledge about who is saying what (also i am not aware of the topic being discussed). so its not the video content but the communication that i noticed and just mentioned that here. the only thing i talked about in my initial comment is that i coudnt watch it because of her way of speaking.

Hm... probably im just hyper pedantic about sticking to what is said in conversations like these.
Because, like... ...If you would speak to someone. in the same room. about a topic you are knowledgable about. And the person would just talk abslute shit at you, like lazy uninspired, not even new challanging, sort of on the edge falsehoods(the one that borders on insidious deseption, like disinformation, that is close to true but manipulated to give you a lie as a conclusion), not even that. Would you not express your intenst disagreement with the person until its your turn to speak/respond?

i understand from your comment that you are passionate about this topic and far more knowledgeable than i am.

idk... maybe im just more attuned to this rhytmic flow of wellness baloney.
Its just a pet peeve of mine.

han i am. but try not to read between the lines please. everyone has some core values, one of my core value is respectful engagement and i didnt see that in Dr. love in this video

I will challange that! :)
Dr Cohen didnt bring the integrity, The Professional Integrity, or the basic humility to engage in an intellectually honest conversation with a her peers.
She doesnt deserve this aggressive accomodation of consequence-free speech in a conversation where we expressly try to contain a conversation to specific, measured and honest statements, because the sort of mission statement of the engagement is to come to a conclusion about the realities of, in this case the human biologies inner workings.(this sentence came out like a rococo art-piece, ima throw up... sorry)

Im always kind of thorny about these things, when the actual offender is let off the hook while the one rightly pushes back on malicious people. Its like seeing a bully get coddled seconds after an altercation, its such a slap in the face of the well-intentioned. (...childhood emotional, that probably never gonna go away. aAAnyway!...) So that "core value" definietly misfired here, i would argue. ..but you know... it happenst all the time these days.

(maybe Dr cohen was too careful to not show it or at least i didnt see it

Dr Cohen is on a book tour, she just has to smile for 5-10 minutes at a morning tv segment and go about her day. (i dont actually know what brought her to appear on this podcast, cause im Sure she way made aware, that a science communicator is going to participate in the conversation (well, 2, but Mike is the host))
I also picked up one time a very specific soundbite, that is very ...like im 1000% sure that is a 1:1 coaching line (...guess legal coaching is the same for a book tour, and a congressional testimony) So yeah, promoting a book is just a smile and dip gig ig. (ik ist super exhausting, but i thought it was a funny line)

lastly, i understand if you don't understand what i am saying because it is difficult (at least for me) to communicate via messages, but i gave my best shot. i wish i could tell you my demography and my profession,

YES! anonimity is hugely important on the internet. I do not know your journey and how you form your reactions to things, but ossified things like that can slip in involuntarily.

PS: Also, since we are talking under a post from THE Dr Mike reddit account.

Mike is a lousy interviewer.

;) (affectionately :D)

I know its super hard to balance a conversation and a "Jon Stewart at his peak" performance is not not a baseline expectation, but

My man! You got hit in the face like 4 times with shit you Clowned on in reaction videos, and meme reviews. And the reaction here is to half-address the assertion, and throw back a light question, or just ignore it and move on? Chmon!

Listened to some of Dr Loves and Dr Steiers podcasts in the last couple of days.

this one a pretty nice topic, and cool conversation (...other than the fissula parts..yuck!, jk its just normal human things)

this one can be paired up with veritasiums new video, that can out a couple of days ago. You can compare the two, in their overall manner of which these two channels discuss the chosen issues. And how they behave, how they present and digest the information they find out while researching into a topic. And I think there is a huge contrast with how scentist with integrity talk about something, and how wellness influencers do.
Like Actually! If I can ask you one thing. Watch these 2 and sort of get a feel for how serious people approach concerning issues.

What's wrong with Washington examiner?

They just reported what judge ordered. Information is real, but because it comes from source that you don't trust it, you dismiss it. It really explains your next statement that I'm a part of 72%. I dont know if im a part of 72%, because i don't know where she got that number and what was qualification to be in 28%. She didnt give any sources for that research. Can you provide source for her statement?

What i know is statistics and statistics is used in every scientific research. Soo i presume im in 28%, but i dont know for sure.

Please tell me on what side do you belong?

Aw, the old ‚ÄúI have no idea how things work, so I‚Äôm going to make them sound scary and conspiratorial‚Äù approach

It is insanely expensive and time-consuming for documents to be reviewers through the HHS (or any executive agency). The amount of individual offices through which each page has to be reviewed and approved is staggering; not by that individual agency‚Äôs choice, but by outright statutory requirement. Why? Because there are trade agreements, sponsor protocols that are private information, and MOST IMPORTANTLY trial participant information 

The FDA‚Äôs not arguing the public has no right to view those documents. They are arguing they physically cannot review the documents in time with their available staffing at the time.

‚ÄúIn its proposal for its original timeline, the FDA stated the branch handling FOIA requests maintains solely 10 employees ‚Äî all while it is managing almost 400 other individual requests‚Äù

And guess what? Once ordered to release the documents, as they absolutely had to, what happened? There was de-identified patient information that was not redacted. But yayyyy, we got information that no one has done shit with. Apparent by the fact that you didn‚Äôt even realize the documents have already been released as per the new timeline demanded by the court order

You‚Äôve also totally just demonstrated why those institutions are who to trust. The FDA specifically stated the dangers of not having time to review the documents before release, yet complied with the order nonetheless

This almighty conspiratorial power you‚Äôre acting like we should distrust literally complied with the first court order that stated they had to do what the judge wanted them to. Man, how scary and mysterious, this shadow organization which complies with legal missives

Sorry I didn't know they released the data, last time I checked they didnt. Can you please provide a source?

Only birocrats can say that it's insanely costly. Define a dollar amount! Do a calculation, they wanted almost half an hour per page. WTF?

I dont know what you wanted to show with data that there are 400 individual requests. It doesn't matter how many requests there are. Request are for the same data set. That doesn't ad 75 years to send same information to 400 different people.

Trade agreements, sponsor protocols and whatever else is not private information. Research and production was paid by taxpayers all over the world and they have the right to know what they paid for. Its basic transparency issue.

I agree trial participants information has to be redacted, but that can be done in a week. And a week is really generous timeline. There are numerous open source programs that can do that in a matter of minutes, once they setup the program correctly. I can do that in less than a week and i have no formal education in programing.

Please don't projects on me that i don't know how things work.

You made a big problem that one participants was identified and that is a problem. But you are probably fine that many people had and still have bad side effects from vaccine.

Ther is no need for any kind of shadow organisation. Revolving door between FDA and pharmaceutical companies is well documented.

https://www.science.org/content/article/fda-s-revolving-door-companies-often-hire-agency-staffers-who-managed-their-successful

11 of 16 FDA medical examiners were employed by pharmaceutical companies. For me that an alarming % and a big conflict of interest.

If money is the problem pharmaceutical companies can just pay a bit more from their profits that they made from taxpayers money and hire more people.

https://today.uconn.edu/2021/05/why-is-the-fda-funded-in-part-by-the-companies-it-regulates-2/

Today, close to 45% of its budget comes from these user fees that companies pay when they apply for approval of a medical device or drug.

If you don't find a problem that pharmaceutical companies are employing people who are supposed to regulate them you really don't understand how things work. Pay in private sector is much higher, than in FDA. Corruption is real problem.

Bro, what do you mean ‚Äúdo I have a source‚Äù 

Just go to the FOIA documents. You can literally look. Why do you need a news outlet to tell you that the documents are there when you, and literally every other citizen, can go check yourself

https://www.fda.gov/about-fda/center-biologics-evaluation-and-research-cber/biologics-electronic-reading-room-efoia

Why are you on here spouting about how this is all hidden, yet you haven‚Äôt even gone to look for how many documents have been released through the FOIA request? 

You‚Äôre clearly just arguing in bad faith, since at any point you could‚Äôve literally just gone and checked the eFOIA uploads. You‚Äôre not worth engaging with if you‚Äôre just spitting out conspiratorial thinking without actually going to look if the documents you claim aren‚Äôt there, are in fact in the exact place they have been ordered to be

Dr. Love was cut off before she was able to provide more information about that 28% scientific literacy comment, which, yes, did make her appear smug, but she wasn't allowed to finish her point. What she ends up saying later on is that people should be provided good information/data along with context. She also brings up the dangers of having data without context in examples such as banning golden rice and banning parabens, which caused infections due to contaminants getting into personal care products. 

she is clearly pro the public being well informed, but she stresses that just giving people facts without the context is not providing them with good information.
