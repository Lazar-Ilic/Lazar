The language strikes a modern reader as relatively flowery throughout, as it does in Hamlet too, but in these there is some attribution to deities in common. And, it is a little unclear if this was more just a way of writing or expressing similar things we would choose to write about in a different way or not. "Zeus who has set men the route", "Artemis the cause", "prayers" (many times), "boasts loud at the altar of Zeus", "Zeus" (many times), "Ares", etc. in Agamemnon. And similarly "Apollo's oracles... ordered me", "Apollo also said that I might pay the penalty instead", "foretold by Loxias, our Lord Apollo, a prophet never known before to lie", "Scylla" metaphor, "Earth", "Hermes, son of Maia, join in justice with us", "Apollo's oracles of truth" in The Libation Bearers.

The effect of all of this creates for the audience, firstly, is to recall a large portion of the mythology corpus. But secondly, it functions in the context of justice a little bit oddly, characters sometimes displaying defeatism almost. In terms of the scales of justice, it in my view does not really emphasive justice the way we might think of justice, I mean but these humans do go up against these figures and make their own choices sometimes despite of them or these recurrent oracular figures.

I think my selected pattern perhaps slightly negatively affects my opinion of the comparison with Hamlet. A close reading of Greek writing reveals much in conjunction with some knowledge of Greek mythology, worship, religion as well as proto Greek beliefs. These are in genuine contrast with the later Judeo Christian themes from which Shakespeare somewhat operated upon. However the capital F Fate is still present in many works and some human elements remain quite similar as Murray points out.
