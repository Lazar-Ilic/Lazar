This course was kind of interesting for me. The instructor tasked us with providing constructive feedback criticism on eachothers' finale projects. And the entire time I stressed how clear, technical, precise, and explicit some of our source texts were. And how I chose them for my projects so that my theses would be more readily defensible. Dr. Vouga writes that there is a lack of nuance nowadays. And I was also thinking about Aaron Sorkin poker film Molly's game which I viewed in a cinema with my parents. The ending is brutally laughably explicit. And I realised it's OK it's OK in a lot of contexts to be heavy heavy heavy handed and emphatic lest the reader miss the points. However, my finale would have been subtle on screen in some ways to be sure.
