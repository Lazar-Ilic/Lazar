In the quintessential monologue in Act 3 Scene 1, Hamlet repeats "sleep": "To die, to sleep", "and by a sleep to say we end", "To die, to sleep", "To sleep, perchance to dream", "For in that sleep of death what dreams may come". It is interesting and oft noted in the literature of analyses. It is a metaphor not quite like general Christian after life writing. Of course we are between the death of his father and of Hamlet him self and that he ultimately has a "dread of something after death" and thus prefers a "weary life". Throughout Hamlet I sense not only the language is very different from what I am used to but in fact humans back then had much less and different sources of stimulation and Shakespeare is very prone to discussing extremely Earthly matters of ears, hearts, bones, flesh, eyes, some sensory minutiae which people nowadays don't write about so much. As for sleeping, it shows rather than tells Hamlet's feelings and how he might imagine that suicide is not so un pleasant versus his suffering existence. It ought to be noted here that historically views on suicide are rather varied. And that suffering is a theme in Hamlet.
