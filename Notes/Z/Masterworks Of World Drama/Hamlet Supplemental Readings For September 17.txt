I was assigned to Richard Burton and his Introduction to Hamlet from the 1954 edition by the London Folio Society. In the footnote, he is described as an actor who played the role of Prince Hamlet at the Old Vic and then in New York later, after the publication of this introduction. He is described as "mesmerizing, powerful, unpredictable, capable of sharp wit, profound reflection". The filmed record is famous enough to warrant its own Wikipedia page with e.g. commentary on Burton's preference against period costumes and towards street clothes. His own truly massive Wikipedia page says he is widely regarded as one of the most acclaimed actors of his generation and was active in the 50s and 60s, earning very large amounts of money and acting in many many films. For a colour image file see e.g.:

His point is that Hamlet is extremely controversial and has been commented on so extensively (already, by 1954) that an actor can only "embody" some "subleties" in "one performance". He goes on to assert that Hamlet is a unique character in "all literature" in how different distinct readers can imagine him. And he suggests that actors tasked with Hamlet consult the source script rather than the extant analysis literature surrounding this play. He further comments on how the reader may find reflection of them self in the Hamlet character, somehow a mirror despite an immense amount of sophistication, and discusses some previous performances and writings. Well he meanders a little through the play which I find to be a bit annoying in an introduction which then terminates with the thesis I suppose "Here is the play. Read it. The greatness is here in the bald, printed line". Perhaps a takeaway is: read the play, act Hamlet, observe other writing and acting and see for your self how others see Hamlet in the play.
