Insofar as "justice" is concerned certainly the original Greek words, time, place, context, and Aristotle him self are distinct from our case. And yet he touches on a now critical central aspect which is the written laws and means by which they are enacted. It seems the officers in the Blake case thought arrest was appropriate and a somewhat common sequence of actions took place. Interactions can go this way and the word "threat" can be written and orated. Procedurally, investigations can occur and names can be made public. In terms of rectification (end of 2 "others are violent" e.g.) an officer can be disciplined, put on leave, fired, arrested, etc. however will not take shots to the back! As for the ability of the Justice Department to ascertain the "just" it is supposed that they are significantly more competent in that task vis a vis the broader American voting populus. But this sort of devolves in to tautology about the "just" being an experience of the human doing the perception.

Beth he wants to stop relatively minor criminals from "getting... other women pregnant" which echoes what most nowadays see as highly disturbing rhetoric to do with sterilization policy and seems quite out of proportion and balance. He seems to be voluntary and complicit in creating departmental policy of racist outcomes in the treatment of white and black people. But in America we must remember that his speech is lawful, protected by the first amendment, and the voters are free to cast in his favour. Aristotle does not always cohere as well formulated to me but many would assert casually that Beth is him self unjust and a racist in both words and action.
