I am from Austin, Texas. I am ostensibly studying mathematics, but dedicate most of my intellectual labour towards computer science. I have 0 hobbies. I would frame this as me being in a phase of my life where I am blessed to love my work. I suppose that some of my puzzle solving, like the Bloomberg Opinion column Kominers's Conundrums, would be seen by some as rather hobbyistic. I also still enjoy a little Wikipedia on my phone sometimes before bed to remind myself of history. Maybe even a couple blogs.

In this course, I am hoping to get practice with my writing and with writing feedback on others' writing. An understanding of dance is secondary for me, and I am a wee bit nervous for the actual outings and dance sessions. No real concerns, I think the Syllabus was a nice document. I understand that hybrid remote learning is not quite the same as human interaction in the corporeality of reality! Alas!

Dance is usually tied with the human body. I might have an interest in the robotic. Perhaps also in meme dances, and in particular in clout chasers who tried to create a viral little dance move but failed. The serious academic study of those could be fun. And also there is a growing trend of tightly choreographed group dance films associated with Korean pop. Maybe a project on The Matrix film series and fight cinema qua dance, perhaps if the instructor deemed some film at the intersection of fight and dance to be worth writing about.
