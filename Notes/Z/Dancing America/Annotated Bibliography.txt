Ackerman, Evan. “How Boston Dynamics Taught Its Robots to Dance.” IEEE Spectrum, IEEE Spectrum, 24 June 2021, https://spectrum.ieee.org/how-boston-dynamics-taught-its-robots-to-dance. 

This is interesting it discusses the video being viewed nearly 24 million times after a certain period of time as well as the non ground breaking nature of the stuff on display. But it reveals that Boston Dynamics actually worked with a human choreographer in production say rather than an artificial one. Video expectations and receptions drumming up hype for the robots they produce and what precisely it is that they are quite capable of doing and executing.

This one is about Artificial Intelligence driven dance and computer programs. Somewhat interesting too. Auxiliary tools and the Google firm!

Ngowi, Rodrique. “Behind Those Dancing Robots, Scientists Had to Bust a Move.” Associated Press, 20 Apr. 2021, https://apnews.com/article/boston-dynamics-robot-dancing-d684559324a385209c0da353a76363bc.

Working hard. Signals, scientists, public reception. Our job is to stretch the boundaries. Perhaps some selected quotations like this one.

Well this one talks more about how humans find some robots to be rather frightening and how we might aspire to making them seem more friendly, reassured, and safe. So we care about how humans draw patterns and emotional meaning from movement in how we design movement.

This one was interesting since it observes a number of things over the discrete series of releases of Boston Dynamics robots films. So previously they did not mention human choreographers but here they do. And the robots can more tightly approximate actual simultaneous movement than a group of humans could. And of course the simpler and more "robotic" the movement perhaps the more tightly humans could try to execute but like now these robots can do human movements in that way nearly so I do not know predict the future maybe we get some Boston Dynamic films with clothes on too!

Rella, Emily. “‘creepy’ Video of Robots Dancing Causes Internet Frenzy -- and Even Elon Musk Is Weighing In.” Entrepreneur, 19 July 2021, https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/377766.

Apparently some film freaked out some people and terrified them. And the famous public intellectual and Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk took the time and energy to compose some Tweets on the topic.

Skybetter, Sydney. “Meet the Choreographer behind Those Dancing Robots.” Dance Magazine, 26 Mar. 2021, https://www.dancemagazine.com/boston-dynamics-dancing-robots/.

Nice to read a transcript of Monica Thomas the choreographer. Really interesting little technical details from her end on what they can and cannot do and how they get away with what they do. I can opt to not incorporate this into my Final as that sort of detail and nuance may render my own piece a little bit too long, protracted, verbose, and clunky. Not really optimise the reader experience towards what I want for it to be on their end. Or what message and story I want to spin.

Rubin, Mike. “Who Knew That Robots Were Funky?” The New York Times, The New York Times, 4 Dec. 2009, https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/06/arts/music/06kraftwerk.html.

It was an OK piece included some more technical details. I myself am a man who owns some technology. I would suppose that some of these things did influence Ralf Hutter. One must always recall the history in order so back when Neon Lights was released it was possibly very phenomenologically interesting to him, who can know for sure I mean.

Sayej, Nadja. “How Daft Punk and Kraftwerk Shaped ’90s Style.” Garage, 15 Apr. 2019, https://garage.vice.com/en/article/mb8jx3/daft-punk-kraftwerk-dance-music.

Well it talks about fashion and a variety of things about the scene. I learned more about France and Hollywood cinema special effects. Again it is for me more causally revealing on some stuff I did not know or sort of failed to appreciate about what precisely was behind these particular old dudes whom I think quite highly of. And the art director is a real human too executing a serious task for them and their label firm. Of course it goes beyond Deadmau5 into Marshmello too who was actually once seriously half anonymous.

Petridis, Alexis. “Raves, Robots and Writhing Bodies: How Electronic Music Rewired the World.” The Guardian, The Guardian, 15 Apr. 2019, https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/apr/15/raves-robots-and-writhing-bodies-how-electronic-music-rewired-the-world.

Of course my own writing on this topic is nearly lower bounded and is more interesting to me personally. But this discusses some things. To be sure Brian Eno matters but really just being in the trance of a sequencer instrument apparatus is already intriguing from moving from a classical background into that sort of setting. A bunch of boring and inane ranting about audiovisual experiences and raves which I frankly do not care much about.

Barnes, Marcus. “From Germany to Detroit and Back: How Kraftwerk Forged an Industrial Exchange.” The Guardian, The Guardian, 25 May 2020, https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/may/25/from-germany-to-detroit-and-back-how-kraftwerk-forged-an-industrial-exchange.

This is not so much about dance it is more about a serious history which I know much much much more about than the author most likely.

Fuhrer, Margaret. “A Hip-Hop Dance Crew’s Frabjous Reign in Las Vegas.” The New York Times, The New York Times, 11 June 2021, https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/11/arts/dance/Jabbawockeez-las-vegas.html.

Kind of interesting some actual stories about when dance troupes make it how they can make it nowadays. I could talk more about the Las Vegas dance scene perhaps.

How they make decisions as a group is kind of interesting. Leaderless power structure. Yeah it is OK I could look more up but this kind of does give me more for this segment in my shtick whether or not I try to find 1 more such troupe or am content to halt with this 1.

Mallare, Marie-Lorraine. “Behind the Mask: The Jabbawockeez, America.” Dancersgroup.Org, https://dancersgroup.org/2008/10/behind-the-mask-the-jabbawockeez-america/. Accessed 5 Apr. 2022.

Lewis Carroll, Asian Americans, urban hip hoppers. Seems like a nice little piece some ties to some background and quite a lot of discussion of the actual group. OK cool.

Tidal.Com, https://tidal.com/magazine/article/daft-punks-discovery-at-20/1-77583. Accessed 5 Apr. 2022.

It is mildly humorous of course the notion of a Long Play actual vinyl now being obsoleted by 24 bit depth .FLAC files but some interesting stories I mean a lot of people know a thing or 2 about how One More Time, Harder Better Faster Stronger, really a lot of people liked how some of the "live" mixes popped off too at parties um it is interesting enough little piece of writing.

“Daft Punk: Always Moving, Always Innovating, Always Brilliant.” DJMag.Com, 22 Feb. 2021, https://djmag.com/longreads/daft-punk-always-moving-always-innovating-always-brilliant.

Daft Punk has since disbanded so this writing is a little funny. But certainly it says some more stuff if I want to wax on and on about Daft Punk which is a little less dance related I mean talk some about the films or how people would dance at their shows events.

“The Real Story of How Daft Punk Became the Robots.” DJMag.Com, 17 Aug. 2021, https://djmag.com/longreads/real-story-how-daft-punk-became-robots.

This one was pretty interesting see my other notes it contains useful historical notes. I know that more and more robotic characters lead to more like kids doing robot costumes at Halloween and stuff.

Yeah just saw your feedback and I was also realising that as I took comments and notes through sources that I want to aim to compose a terse piece with a focused message and point. So I might actually just restrict myself to discussing the series of Boston Dynamics films and perhaps talk about their human choreographer as well as the Google firm and their technologies they may generate to help human dance choreographers.
