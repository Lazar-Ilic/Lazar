 I chose the 2160p 4k film Atlas | Partners In Parkour from the "Boston Dynamics" YouTube channel. This is a 65s short film with a terse description about the history of the word "parkour" and the implict ability to interact with novel environments perhaps. They have yet to clothe the humanoid robots and there is something particularly notable around the 38s-39s mark. A little stumble almost, not a huge fall, but an imperfect lapse nevertheless it appears like. This was probably not programmed or intentional and it does not seem that they use added noise or "wabi-sabi" elements to produce a more pleasant, human like, and less reported negative feelings for the viewer. Most would see clearly the actions of fairly well sensored and modulated robots with auto balancing capability when say they mis measured the environment or it was an unpredictable underlying shifting environment though this one appears to be relatively static. It is still a little unclear how these so called Atlas robots will be holding up the economics of the real world. Perhaps these dudes will serve ramen in Tokyo and chestnuts in Paris? Athletic intelligence is a funny turn of phrase in the context of proprioception. Will they help soccer and football teams train? Again, the synchronisation is better than human performance, and it is a fun little flick set to a primary Red, Blue, Yellow colour scheme with like wooden boxes and crates which appeal to some who see those sorts of esthetic elements appearing in contemporary video games map designs, but the robots themselves sort of are the centerpiece of the show. And the whole robot mask on mask off duality is presented more aptly in Ex Machina by Alex Garland of course.
