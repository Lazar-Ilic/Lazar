I have a huge corpus which I will post most likely immediately following some interviews and processes. Perhaps removing tasks which I onsighted due to being precomputed and memorised.

Gwern has a fairly interesting set of papers to review in learning more about this corpus. I may even tike the time to verify to the readership that I can gaze upon these papers and copy and paste their abstracts here. Exceedingly fascinating corpus he has chosen to link me towards and I must impress him with unpredictable and intelligent insightful commentary shortly!
