Examples of statistics functions in trading applications.

----------

In trading applications, statistical functions from Pandas are widely used for analyzing market trends, risk assessment, and strategy development. Here are some key examples:

### **1. Moving Averages (SMA & EMA)**
Used to smooth price data and identify trends.
```python
df['SMA_50'] = df['Close'].rolling(window=50).mean()  # 50-day Simple Moving Average
df['EMA_20'] = df['Close'].ewm(span=20, adjust=False).mean()  # 20-day Exponential Moving Average
```

### **2. Daily Returns**
Measures the percentage change in stock prices.
```python
df['Daily_Return'] = df['Close'].pct_change()
```

### **3. Cumulative Returns**
Tracks overall investment performance.
```python
df['Cumulative_Return'] = (1 + df['Daily_Return']).cumprod()
```

### **4. Volatility (Standard Deviation)**
Measures the risk or price fluctuations.
```python
df['Volatility'] = df['Daily_Return'].rolling(window=30).std()  # 30-day volatility
```

### **5. Correlation Between Stocks**
Helps in portfolio diversification.
```python
correlation_matrix = df[['Stock_A', 'Stock_B']].corr()
```

### **6. Relative Strength Index (RSI)**
Measures momentum to identify overbought/oversold conditions.
```python
delta = df['Close'].diff()
gain = (delta.where(delta > 0, 0)).rolling(window=14).mean()
loss = (-delta.where(delta < 0, 0)).rolling(window=14).mean()
rs = gain / loss
df['RSI'] = 100 - (100 / (1 + rs))
```

### **7. Bollinger Bands**
Identifies volatility and potential breakouts.
```python
df['Middle_Band'] = df['Close'].rolling(window=20).mean()
df['Upper_Band'] = df['Middle_Band'] + (df['Close'].rolling(window=20).std() * 2)
df['Lower_Band'] = df['Middle_Band'] - (df['Close'].rolling(window=20).std() * 2)
```

### **8. Sharpe Ratio**
Evaluates risk-adjusted returns.
```python
rf = 0.02  # Risk-free rate (example)
df['Excess_Return'] = df['Daily_Return'] - rf / 252  # Adjust for daily risk-free rate
sharpe_ratio = df['Excess_Return'].mean() / df['Excess_Return'].std()
```

Would you like me to generate a sample dataset and apply these calculations? 📊

----------

Please examine NFL betting odds where the odds shifted dramatically in the days leading in to the game and try to write an algorithm to identify future games where this sort of market behaviour is predicted to occur.

----------

Significant shifts in NFL betting odds often occur due to factors such as player injuries, weather changes, or substantial betting activity on one side. For instance, if a key player is injured during practice, sportsbooks may adjust the odds to reflect the team's decreased chances of winning. Similarly, unexpected weather conditions can influence game dynamics, prompting oddsmakers to modify lines accordingly. Additionally, if a large volume of bets is placed on one team, sportsbooks might alter the odds to balance their exposure.

To identify games where such dramatic line movements are likely to occur, consider the following algorithmic approach:

1. **Data Collection**: Gather historical data on NFL games, including opening and closing betting lines, injury reports, weather forecasts, and betting volumes.

2. **Feature Engineering**:
   - **Injury Reports**: Quantify the impact of player injuries by assigning weights based on player positions and importance.
   - **Weather Conditions**: Analyze how different weather scenarios have historically affected game outcomes and betting lines.
   - **Betting Volume Disparities**: Monitor the distribution of bets to detect lopsided betting patterns.

3. **Model Development**:
   - Utilize machine learning techniques to develop a predictive model that correlates the engineered features with historical line movements.
   - Train the model on a portion of the dataset and validate its accuracy on the remaining data.

4. **Real-Time Monitoring**:
   - Implement a system to continuously monitor current injury reports, weather updates, and betting volumes.
   - Input this real-time data into the predictive model to assess the likelihood of significant line movements for upcoming games.

5. **Alert Mechanism**:
   - Establish thresholds for predicted line movement probabilities.
   - When the model indicates a high probability of dramatic line shifts, trigger alerts for further analysis or potential betting opportunities.

By systematically analyzing these factors, the algorithm can help anticipate games where betting odds are poised for significant changes, enabling bettors to make more informed decisions.

Do trading firms like Susquehanna have sophisticated models for moments like player injury reports where one might expect jump discontinuities?

----------

Yes, trading firms like **Susquehanna International Group (SIG)** and other high-frequency trading (HFT) firms have **extremely sophisticated models** to react to events like **player injury reports, coaching changes, weather updates, and other breaking news** that cause sudden shifts in betting odds or financial markets.

### **How These Firms Handle Jump Discontinuities in Sports Betting**
1. **Natural Language Processing (NLP) for News Scanning**  
   - Firms use **real-time scraping** of injury reports, Twitter, insider sources, and betting markets.
   - **Machine learning models** classify the significance of news (e.g., a star QB injury vs. a backup lineman).

2. **Market-Making Models with Instant Adjustments**  
   - HFT firms maintain **predictive models** that constantly update probabilities.  
   - When an injury report comes out, their models automatically **adjust win probabilities** and **place bets faster** than retail bettors or sportsbooks can react.

3. **Jump Discontinuity Detection via Statistical Models**  
   - Firms use **hidden Markov models (HMMs), Bayesian changepoint detection, and stochastic calculus models** to identify abrupt changes in betting markets.  
   - These models help **differentiate normal line movements from major discontinuities** that warrant immediate action.

4. **Quantifying Impact with Monte Carlo Simulations**  
   - If a key player is ruled out, simulations adjust expected team performance **on the fly**, updating models that price **point spreads, moneylines, and player props**.

5. **Latency Arbitrage & Market Reaction Speed**  
   - These firms **scrape multiple sportsbooks** and take advantage of **latency differences** before books fully adjust.
   - If **Book A moves the line but Book B lags**, they exploit arbitrage before alignment.

### **How This Compares to Traditional Betting**  
Most casual and even professional bettors can’t react fast enough. By the time they process news, **firms like SIG have already moved the market**. This is why **sharp bettors often find it difficult to profit off injury news unless they get an early tip or beat the books manually**.

Would you be interested in a more detailed **algorithmic trading approach** for this kind of market behavior?

---

## **1. Detrending a Time Series (`scipy.signal.detrend`)**
Removes linear trends from time series data.

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from scipy.signal import detrend

# Generate synthetic data (trend + noise)
t = np.linspace(0, 10, 100)
y = 2 * t + 5 + np.random.normal(scale=2, size=len(t))  # Linear trend + noise

# Remove trend
y_detrended = detrend(y)

# Plot
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 4))

### **Would you like to see more advanced techniques like ARIMA, Kalman filters, or LSTMs?** 🚀

----------

SciPy itself does not directly provide an ARIMA implementation, but you can use the `statsmodels` library, which is commonly used in Python for time series analysis and includes ARIMA models. Below are some examples of how to use ARIMA with `statsmodels`.

First, make sure you have the `statsmodels` library installed. You can install it using pip if you haven't already:

```bash
pip install statsmodels
```

Here are some examples of how to use ARIMA with `statsmodels`:

### Example 1: Basic ARIMA Model

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from statsmodels.tsa.arima.model import ARIMA

# Generate some sample data
np.random.seed(0)
data = np.random.randn(100).cumsum()

# Fit ARIMA model
model = ARIMA(data, order=(1, 1, 1))
model_fit = model.fit()

# Print summary of the model
print(model_fit.summary())

# Plot the original data and the forecast
plt.plot(data, label='Original')
plt.plot(model_fit.fittedvalues, label='Fitted', color='red')
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```

### Example 2: ARIMA with Seasonal Data

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from statsmodels.tsa.statespace.sarimax import SARIMAX

# Generate some seasonal data
np.random.seed(0)
n = 120
t = np.arange(n)
data = 10 + 0.5 * t + 10 * np.sin(2 * np.pi * t / 12) + np.random.normal(size=n)

# Fit SARIMA model
model = SARIMAX(data, order=(1, 1, 1), seasonal_order=(1, 1, 1, 12))
model_fit = model.fit()

# Print summary of the model
print(model_fit.summary())

# Plot the original data and the forecast
plt.plot(data, label='Original')
plt.plot(model_fit.fittedvalues, label='Fitted', color='red')
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```

### Example 3: Forecasting with ARIMA

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from statsmodels.tsa.arima.model import ARIMA

# Generate some sample data
np.random.seed(0)
data = np.random.randn(100).cumsum()

# Fit ARIMA model
model = ARIMA(data, order=(1, 1, 1))
model_fit = model.fit()

# Forecast the next 10 steps
forecast = model_fit.forecast(steps=10)

# Plot the original data and the forecast
plt.plot(data, label='Original')
plt.plot(np.arange(len(data), len(data) + 10), forecast, label='Forecast', color='green')
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```

These examples demonstrate how to fit an ARIMA model to time series data, handle seasonal data with SARIMA, and make forecasts. Adjust the `order` and `seasonal_order` parameters as needed for your specific dataset.

----------

Certainly! When it comes to trading, ARIMA models can be used to forecast future prices or returns based on historical data. Below are some examples of how you might use ARIMA models in a trading context. These examples assume you have access to historical stock price data, which you can obtain from various sources like Yahoo Finance or other financial data providers.

### Example 1: Forecasting Stock Prices

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from statsmodels.tsa.arima.model import ARIMA
import yfinance as yf

# Download historical stock data
ticker = 'AAPL'
data = yf.download(ticker, start='2020-01-01', end='2023-01-01')
prices = data['Close']

# Fit ARIMA model
model = ARIMA(prices, order=(5, 1, 0))  # Adjust order as needed
model_fit = model.fit()

# Print summary of the model
print(model_fit.summary())

# Forecast the next 30 days
forecast = model_fit.forecast(steps=30)

# Plot the original data and the forecast
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))
plt.plot(prices, label='Historical Prices')
plt.plot(pd.date_range(prices.index[-1], periods=30, freq='B'), forecast, label='Forecast', color='green')
plt.title(f'{ticker} Stock Price Forecast')
plt.xlabel('Date')
plt.ylabel('Price')
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```

### Example 2: Trading Strategy Based on Forecast

In this example, we'll create a simple trading strategy based on the ARIMA forecast. This is a basic example and should not be used as a real trading strategy without further refinement and backtesting.

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from statsmodels.tsa.arima.model import ARIMA
import yfinance as yf

# Download historical stock data
ticker = 'AAPL'
data = yf.download(ticker, start='2020-01-01', end='2023-01-01')
prices = data['Close']

# Fit ARIMA model
model = ARIMA(prices, order=(5, 1, 0))  # Adjust order as needed
model_fit = model.fit()

# Forecast the next day
forecast = model_fit.forecast(steps=1)[0]

# Simple trading strategy: Buy if forecast is higher than last price, sell otherwise
last_price = prices.iloc[-1]
if forecast > last_price:
    print(f"Buy signal: Forecasted price ({forecast:.2f}) is higher than last price ({last_price:.2f})")
else:
    print(f"Sell signal: Forecasted price ({forecast:.2f}) is lower than last price ({last_price:.2f})")

# Plot the original data and the forecast
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))
plt.plot(prices, label='Historical Prices')
plt.axhline(y=forecast, color='green', linestyle='--', label='Forecasted Price')
plt.title(f'{ticker} Stock Price and Forecast')
plt.xlabel('Date')
plt.ylabel('Price')
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```

### Important Considerations

1. **Model Order**: The `(p, d, q)` parameters in the ARIMA model need to be chosen carefully. You can use techniques like AIC/BIC or grid search to find the optimal parameters.

2. **Backtesting**: Always backtest your trading strategy on historical data to evaluate its performance before using it in a live trading environment.

3. **Risk Management**: Incorporate risk management techniques to protect against large losses.

4. **Market Conditions**: ARIMA models assume that past patterns will continue, which may not always be true in volatile markets.

These examples are simplified and meant for educational purposes. In practice, developing a robust trading strategy involves more complex modeling, risk management, and continuous evaluation.
