Python provides several built-in data structures, each implemented efficiently using underlying C constructs. Here's a look at how the most common data structures are implemented under the hood:

---

### **1. Lists (`list`)**
- **Implementation:** Python lists are implemented as **dynamic arrays** (similar to C arrays but dynamically resizable).
- **Memory Allocation:** Lists allocate extra memory (over-allocation) to accommodate future growth and minimize costly reallocations.
- **Time Complexity:**
  - Indexing: \( O(1) \) (direct pointer access)
  - Append: \( O(1) \) amortized (due to occasional resizing)
  - Insert/Delete: \( O(n) \) (shifting elements)
  - Iteration: \( O(n) \)

---

### **2. Tuples (`tuple`)**
- **Implementation:** Tuples are immutable sequences stored as contiguous arrays.
- **Memory Efficiency:** Since tuples are immutable, Python optimizes their storage by avoiding over-allocation.
- **Time Complexity:**
  - Indexing: \( O(1) \)
  - Iteration: \( O(n) \)

---

### **3. Sets (`set`)**
- **Implementation:** Python sets are implemented using **hash tables** (similar to dictionaries but with only keys).
- **Collision Resolution:** Uses **open addressing with probing**.
- **Time Complexity:**
  - Add/Remove/Check Membership: \( O(1) \) average, \( O(n) \) worst-case (due to hash collisions)
  - Iteration: \( O(n) \)

---

### **4. Dictionaries (`dict`)**
- **Implementation:** Implemented as a **hash table** with **open addressing** and **perturbation probing** for collision resolution.
- **Efficiency:** Python dictionaries maintain insertion order (since Python 3.7+).
- **Time Complexity:**
  - Lookup/Insert/Delete: \( O(1) \) average, \( O(n) \) worst-case
  - Iteration: \( O(n) \)

---

### **5. Strings (`str`)**
- **Implementation:** Implemented as **immutable arrays** of Unicode characters.
- **Optimizations:**
  - Uses **interning** for short strings (saves memory by storing only one copy).
  - Supports **copy-on-write** for substring operations.
- **Time Complexity:**
  - Indexing: \( O(1) \)
  - Concatenation: \( O(n) \) (due to new allocation)
  - Slicing: \( O(k) \) where \( k \) is the slice size

---

### **6. Linked Lists (`collections.deque`)**
- **Implementation:** Uses a **doubly linked list** internally.
- **Benefits:** Efficient \( O(1) \) insertions/removals from both ends.
- **Time Complexity:**
  - Append/Pop (both ends): \( O(1) \)
  - Random Access: \( O(n) \)

### **Python Dictionary (`dict`) - A Deep Dive**
A **dictionary** in Python is a **hash table** that provides fast key-value lookups. Under the hood, it‚Äôs implemented using a **hash table with open addressing** and **perturbation probing** for efficient collision resolution. Let's break it all down.

---

## **1. How is a Dictionary Stored?**
A Python dictionary is essentially a **resizable array of key-value pairs**. Each entry (or "bucket") in the array can store:  
- A **key** (must be hashable)
- A **value** (can be anything)
- A **hash value** (precomputed to speed up lookups)

‚úÖ Python dictionaries **preserve insertion order** (since Python 3.7).

---

## **2. How Does a Dictionary Lookup Work?**
When you do something like:
```python
my_dict = {"apple": 5, "banana": 8, "cherry": 12}
print(my_dict["banana"])  # Output: 8
```
This happens under the hood:

1. **Compute the hash** of `"banana"` using Python‚Äôs built-in `hash()` function.
   ```python
   hash("banana")  # Generates an integer hash
   ```
2. **Find the bucket** where `"banana"` should be stored in the dictionary‚Äôs internal array.
   - The hash value is **modulo-ed** (`hash % array_size`) to determine the index.
3. **Check if the key exists** at that index.
   - If the bucket contains `"banana"`, return its value `8`.
   - If there's a different key in that bucket (a **collision**), Python probes other positions using **perturbation probing** (a special mix of linear and quadratic probing).
   
üöÄ **Time Complexity: \( O(1) \) on average** for lookups.

---

## **3. Collision Handling (Open Addressing)**
Because dictionaries rely on **hashing**, two keys may have the **same hash index** (collision). Python resolves this using **open addressing**, meaning:
- Instead of storing a **linked list** in the bucket (like Java's `HashMap`), Python **searches for the next free slot** using a special probing technique.

**Example:**
```python
my_dict = {}
my_dict["abc"] = 1
my_dict["xyz"] = 2  # This could collide with "abc"
```
If `"xyz"` maps to the same index as `"abc"`, Python looks for the **next available slot**.

‚úÖ **Advantage**: No need for linked lists, making dictionary lookups and insertions faster.

---

## **4. Dictionary Resizing**
Python dictionaries start small but **grow dynamically** when they get too full.

### **How Resizing Works**
- If the dictionary is **at least 2/3 full**, Python resizes it.
- The size increases to **the next power of 2** (approximately **double** the current size).
- **All keys are rehashed and redistributed** into the new larger table.

üî¥ **Downside**: Resizing can be slow since all existing keys must be rehashed.

---

## **5. Iterating Over a Dictionary**
```python
my_dict = {"apple": 5, "banana": 8, "cherry": 12}

for key, value in my_dict.items():
    print(key, value)
```
- Python **iterates over the internal storage order** (insertion order since Python 3.7).
- Time Complexity: **\( O(n) \)**

---

## **6. Deleting Elements**
When you delete a key:
```python
del my_dict["banana"]
```
- Python **marks the slot as deleted** instead of shifting elements.
- Later, these deleted slots get reused.

---

## **7. Dictionary Performance Summary**
| Operation    | Average Time Complexity | Worst-case Time Complexity |
|-------------|----------------------|----------------------|
| Lookup (`dict[key]`)  | \( O(1) \)  | \( O(n) \) (rare collisions) |
| Insertion (`dict[key] = value`) | \( O(1) \) | \( O(n) \) (rare rehashing) |
| Deletion (`del dict[key]`) | \( O(1) \) | \( O(n) \) |
| Iteration (`for key in dict`) | \( O(n) \) | \( O(n) \) |

üîπ **Why is the worst case \( O(n) \)?**
- If all keys collide into the same bucket (due to a bad hash function), Python has to scan the whole dictionary to find the key.
- This is extremely rare because Python‚Äôs hash function is well-designed.

---

## **8. Optimizations in Python 3.6+**
- **Compact Dictionaries**: Instead of a large array with lots of empty space, Python 3.6+ **stores dictionary elements in a smaller secondary array**.
- **Insertion Order Preservation**: Since Python 3.7, dictionaries **remember the order keys were inserted**.

---

## **9. Example of How a Dictionary Works Under the Hood**
```python
class SimpleDict:
    def __init__(self, size=8):
        self.size = size
        self.keys = [None] * size
        self.values = [None] * size
    
    def _hash(self, key):
        return hash(key) % self.size  # Simple modulo-based hash

    def insert(self, key, value):
        index = self._hash(key)
        while self.keys[index] is not None:
            if self.keys[index] == key:
                self.values[index] = value  # Update existing key
                return
            index = (index + 1) % self.size  # Linear probing
        self.keys[index] = key
        self.values[index] = value

    def get(self, key):
        index = self._hash(key)
        while self.keys[index] is not None:
            if self.keys[index] == key:
                return self.values[index]
            index = (index + 1) % self.size  # Linear probing
        raise KeyError("Key not found")

# Example Usage
d = SimpleDict()
d.insert("apple", 5)
d.insert("banana", 8)
print(d.get("apple"))  # Output: 5
```
This simple implementation follows **open addressing with linear probing**, just like Python‚Äôs dictionary.

---

## **Conclusion**
- **Python‚Äôs dictionary is a highly optimized hash table** that offers fast insertions, lookups, and deletions.
- It uses **open addressing with perturbation probing** for collision resolution.
- **Resizes dynamically** when it gets too full.
- Since **Python 3.7, insertion order is preserved**.
