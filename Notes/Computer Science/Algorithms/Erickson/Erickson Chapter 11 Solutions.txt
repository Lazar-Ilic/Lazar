"So I'm the bad guy now I hear, because I don't go with the flow.
Don't ever go with the flow, be the flow."

Yes. Start with an out edge from v and keep on adding unused edges until we hit u. This is valid by definition as each in to a vertex will induce a valid out unless we have hit u. Iterate k times. I.e. the k edge-disjoint paths necessarily induce k edge-disjoint cycles from u to u through v.

2
Source v with relevant capacity 1 edges and target with capacity 1 edges from u and w. If and only if maximum flow is 2.

3
(a) Definition
(b) Source with an infinite capacity edge to each source and target with an infinite capacity edge from each target and run maximum flow from source to target.

4
Vertex capacity 1 condition and run maximum flow minimum cut. The cut set of edges corresponds with a minimal set of stations to be closed.

5
(a) Source with capacity 1 edge to each terminal, target with capacity 1 edge from each boundary vertex, vertex capacity 1 condition, capacity 1 edges, and run if and only if maximum flow is m.
(b) 
(c) 

6
Maximum bipartite matching. Underlying graph can be computed via radial sorting.

7
Each vertex must have degree 2. Force via replacing each vertex with a K{d,d-2} and naturally induce the original graph from the left components. Cycle cover if and only if complete matching. See Tutte 1954. Further vertex expansion is a powerful general technique and this works for forcing any desired combination of degrees.

8
If and only if complete bipartite matching. See Thiant 2003. See Pak, Sheffer, Tassy 2016 for simply connected regions.

9
Source with capacity 1 edge to each row, target with capacity 1 edge from each column, capacity 1 edge between row and column if and only if white square, if and only if maximum flow is n.

10
Run DAG disjoint path cover to produce minimal chain decomposition.

11
(a) Directed edge if and only if to is down-right of from then process in order i.e. left to right then top to bottom storing maximal path from source terminating at each vertex i.e. by propagating through each edge if relevant while processing a vertex then output the target value.
(b) Trivially for example in
OXX
XXO
If the first maximal monotone path is
YYO
OYY
Then the remainder is
OOX
XOO
Which requires another 2 paths is a total of 3 is suboptimal as it can be done in 2.
(c) Run DAG disjoint path cover.

12
Source with capacity d/3 edges to assistant, associate, and full with capacity 1 edges to relevant professors with capacity 1 edges to relevant departments with capacity 1 edges to target. If and only if maximum flow is d.

13
Source with capacity 1 edges to taken courses with capacity 1 edges to relevant requirements with capacity must take edges to target. If and only if maximum flow is sum of must takes.

14
Source with capacity 3 edges to each Disc Jockey with capacity 1 edges to each relevant genre with capacity 1 edges to each day with capacity k edges to target. If and only if maximum flow is 3k.

15
Source with capacity 1 edges to each visitor with capacity 1 edges to each relevant demographic group with capacity how many to each relevant advertiser with capacity how many to target. If and only if maximum flow is sum of how manies.

16
(a) Source with capacity sum modulo 1 to each row with capacity 1 edges to each relevant column with capacity sum modulo 1 to target. If and only if maximum flow is sum modulo 1.
(b) Trivial for obviously impossible.
(c) Trivial possibility check. The construction of 1/0 assignment for each of the mn entries to satisfy the row and column constraints follows via i.e. iterating through if a row and column still need a 1 then fill and decrement from the target remaining values. See "Combinatorial Matrix Theory", "Matrices with prescribed row and column sums" etc.
e.g. if the target is
  2 1 1
1
2
1
Then we simply assign in order
   2 1 1

1  1 0 0
2  1 1 0
1  0 0 1

17
Create an in and an out vertex for each device. Relevant edges from sufficiently close outA to inB and outB to inA. Source with capacity k edges to each out vertex and target with capacity b edges from each in vertex. If and only if maximum flow is nk.

18
One can binary search for threshold on source1 with capacity threshold edge to source2 with infinite capacity edges to class vertices with relevant infinite capacity edges between class vertices with cap capacity edges to target. Threshold is valid if and only if maximum flow is sum of capacities.

19
(a) One can expand each vertex into h timestamped of arrival copies and with infinite capacity edges up each chain. Then induce simply the capacity 1 edges between relevant A{n} and B{n+1} vertices and run maximum flow.
(b) Lacking rigour just a sketch note for sufficiently large h that the long run maximizing behavior emerges from flow 1 person per time step through maximum number of edge-disjoint flow paths whence it suffices to analyze for small h.
(c) Immediately one can binary search for the target threshold via (a) but (b) suffices.

20
(a) Longest increasing subsequence in for example list the neighbors of L1 in decreasing order, then the neighbors of L2 in decreasing order, etc. There exists n log log n via Malucelli 1993
(b) Run DAG disjoint path cover on the graph where edges are vertices and there exists an edge if and only if from was above to in the original. There exists coloring n^2 log log n via Malucelli 2001
Trawl references in Malucelli bibliography.

21
(a) Source to R vertices with edge capacity 2, relevant intraedges with capacity 2, edges from L vertices L1 and L2 to Pair{1}, L2 and L3 to Pair{2} etc. with capacity 1, and edges from Pair vertices to Target with capacity 1. If and only if maximum flow is n-1.7
(b) 
(c)

Feels like I'm running Out Of sOul
YOu're getting heavy tO hOld
Think I'll be letting yOu gO
My self-pOrtrait,
ShOws a man that the wealth tOrtured,
Self absOrbed with his Own self,
FOrfeit a shelf full Of awards,
WOrshipping the war ships that
Set sail On my sea Of life,
The way I see my Own self and
WOnder if we still see a light,
We was tight, seeing lights,
Speaking right and breathing life,
NOw I see my demOns and barely even sleep at night,
I dOn't get high, Life keep me at a decent height,
As the Old me, I predicted all my recent plights,
Exhausted, trying tO fall asleep
LOst inside my recent fights,
Burdens On my shOulders, nOw,
Burning all my mOtOrs dOwn,
InspiratiOn drying up,
MOtivatiOn slOwing dOwn.
Things are getting Out Of cOntrOl
Feels I'm running Out Of sOul
YOu're getting heavy tO hOld
Think I'll be letting yOu gO
I'm begging yOu dOn't let me gO,
We vOwed like the letter O
TO never gO Our separate ways,
TO spin Off intO separate shOws,
Tired Of all the wardrObe changing,
Playing all these extra rOles,
Filled with all these different spirits,
Living Off these separate sOuls,
POint Of life is getting hOllOw,
Can't wait fOr the exit hOle,
Give me rOOm tO entry wOund,
Let me in Or let me gO
SO I can rOam arOund this wilderness,
See it fOr what it really is:
Unprepared and filterless,
Magnify the euphOny,
Alibi the shOOting spree,
Amplify the revOlutiOn,
Sanitise the lunacy,
Strip away the justice,
Justify the scrutiny,
I can see the LASERs shOOting Out Of yOu and me
Things are getting Out Of cOntrOl
Feels like I'm running Out Of sOul
YOu're getting heavy tO hOld
Think I'll be letting yOu gO
SOmetimes I feel like the wOrld
SOmetimes I feel lOnely, and the wOrld is against me
And everything that I've dOne befOre,
I swear we used tO be sO pure
But we can't be in lOve nO mOre
'Cause I dOn't want tO fight this war
But when I put dOwn my gun,
I turn arOund and pick up One
It's an Uzi waste Of time, but I think I'm dOne
Things are getting Out Of cOntrOl
Feels like I'm running Out Of sOul
YOu're getting heavy tO hOld
Think I'll be letting yOu gO
Think I'll be letting yOu gO, gO, gO
Things are getting Out Of cOntrOl
Feels like I'm running Out Of sOul
YOu're getting heavy tO hOld
Think I'll be letting yOu gO
GO, gO, gO, gO...

I grow little of the food I eat, and of the little I do grow I did not breed or perfect the seeds.

I do not make any of my own clothing.

I speak a language I did not invent or refine.

I did not discover the mathematics I use.

I am protected by freedoms and laws I did not conceive of or legislate, and do not enforce or adjudicate.

I am moved by music I did not create myself.

When I needed medical attention, I was helpless to help myself survive.

I did not invent the transistor, the microprocessor, object oriented programming, or most of the technology I work with.

I love and admire my species, living and dead, and am totally dependent on them for my life and well being.
