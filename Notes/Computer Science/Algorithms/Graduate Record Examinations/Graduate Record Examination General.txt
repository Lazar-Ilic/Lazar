I ought to not violate American copyright law so flagrantly in public but one can potentially ping the website to scrape extract all of the underlying .pdf file resources and review through all of them as Step 1 of preparation season. Certainly do the [free] official preparation tests on one's testing machine and read tens of books. Practise writing at least 1|day around the time of scheduled testing, and schedule for Sunday morning if that tends to be quietest and optimal. Attempt to take naked or in bamboo viscose boxers or bamboo viscose tank as requested by the proctor. Memorise tens of dictionaries in .txt files per usual. Do tonnes of mock tests from various sources and read other analyses and strategy documents. Complete essay compilations exist with concrete examples one could coopt. Tonnes of generic boilerplate centre left MAGMA Meta Apple Google Microsoft Amazon optimisation and medical research topics free from Marxian Sociology lingo. Defended rather than defensible, reasoned rather than reasonable, measured rather than measurable, clear rather than clarifiable, predicted rather than predictable, sourced cited rather than citable. Search for free online medium resolution feedback programmes. Memorise specific sets of ~1000 or ~5000 or ~25000 words and definitions produced by people who study and tutor for these specific tests rather than attempting to memorise the entirety of Collins English Dictionary in high resolution. I cringe and sneer at myself over this frankly... I ought to have ACed 1st shot and might shoot 1 more shot at General and halt... use "    " rather than no tab in essays is OK or not... record esoteric missed French vocabulary words immediately afterwards to upsolve via digging up a < 5000 words GRE Graduate Record Examination General vocabulary corpus to study later... there exist little fast tricks for many mathematics tasks. For example, on a task like: if the roots of the equation x^2+Bx+1=0 are the squares of the roots of the equation x^2+bx+1=0, which of the following expresses B in terms of b? Any easy solution is to simply onsight observe that for b=0 we have roots +-i square to -1,-1 for B=2 b=0 fits only 1 of the provided answer choices etc. one can sometimes plug in proposed solution sets prior to upsolving via legitimate algebraic techniques to "verify". It is beneficial to dig up multiple Mathematics Subject Test preparation books as well as reviewing like Joseph Gallian and Dummit Foote Algebra.

Major 2025-09 update I had somehow previously missed: if one scores a 340 + 5.5 and already has a 5.5 locked in, it might be worth requesting a rescore. The user /u/Scott_TargetTestPrep on /r/GRE brought up this notion. Could be the key to increasing probability of a 340 + 6.0.

Maybe I should draft up a list of vocabulary words which might help with a 6.0 like... words which do not appear on GRE lists but also do not sound too pretentious in the right context something like dropping a "interferent".

Example 1st one-shot attempt:

"
A nation should require all of its students to study the same national curriculum until they enter college.
"

"
A nation ought to require most of its students to study a similar base national curriculum prior to entering college. This creates some sense of cohesion in a broader society, and common knowledge in underlying referents. However, some career specialization can also occur in the form of occupational training or science curricula. There exist caveats and nuances in any implementational details of such a policy.

In the United States Of America circa the early 2000s, many schools taught roughly similar content. There were administrators and influential pedagogues at the national, state, and local level guiding decisions made about course content. Many citizens were benchmarked academically on roughly the same general standardized tests over American History, Mathematics, Writing, etc. To be sure, education is always imperfect in the eyes and adjudication of some. But in my experience, many people know how to do useful things like balance their checkbook, manage their personal finances, read Wikipedia|Wiktionary, and even think somewhat critically about data science.

Some private and magnet schools offer prospective parents a more pertinent course on scientific research. Other formal conservatories are much more focused on the production of music. And some premedicine students choose a path with much more emphasis on Human Biology coursework. This is mutually beneficial in the broader national economy and also on the world stage, where imports and exports matter quite a lot. America is strong in many ways. China is strong too. Homogeneity is not necessarily all too much of a good thing, and the No Child Left Behind Act of President George Bush Junior was a controversial piece of legislation.

In formally mandating some degree of understanding of political power structures, the government empowers the citizenship to make potentially better, more informed, decisions during elections. And in training bureaucrats on statistics, much more rational capital allocations can be made in governmental expenditure. This sort of program might not be as necessary in more dictatorial regimes of other nation-states.

A realistic model of reality necessarily involves the fact that different people have different interests and talents, and that a good education system ought to enable more to thrive, without holding anyone back. Thus, we have some high schools offering Advanced Placement courses on top of regularly scheduled ones. I myself enrolled in a few, and scored mostly As with a few Bs as well as 5s and 4s on the official nationwide examinations. This really helped ensure I was aligned with other students around the nation, and world, for that matter. The International Baccalaureate program exists too for this reason. And humanity even has relatively fair global tests of competency, though linguistics and Pre-American Law can sometimes hinder the most accurate gauges of who knows which facts.

It would seem to my relatively cursory gaze and thought as though in most instances, having a system with a common curriculum is good. Trust in others and sense of community can be predicted to rise. A very interesting loophole in education here has to do with homeschooling law. Many homeschoolers find themselves a wee bit isolated and socially abnormal when they matriculate in to undergraduate studies, which is unfortunate. Some might contend this is actually a net positive, for it introduces "viewpoint diversity" in to the mixture at universities. Others would then repartee and suggest there already existed enough difference of thought based around media firms and historical reading traditions. Many European nations and some Asian ones ban homeschooling and enfore this ban quite seriously.

Medicine is probably one of the better domains to sum it up for me. Many great doctors' patients have benefitted massively from their pre-college studies in biology. It is acceptable to force a nationwide history curriculum, but enable domain expertise and young specialists to rise. We all benefit from great diagnosticians and diagnostics, and the healthcare sector is such a critical one in the ongoing global information and moral economy. My personal experience with medicine leads me to being quite awed by a sometimes high-functioning educational system.
"

Analysis: Mediocre. Needs at least 5 more very short sentences. And 1 with a "... - ... - ..." or "... - ..." structure as well as "...;...". Avoid suspicious edgy structures like short "And... ." flows. Use gender neutral pronoun constructions. Stronger outlining up front and segue transitions. "Repartee" is not a verb, stemming from a casual misread and failure to "Let Me Google That For You" upon Robin Hanson's Twitter micro web log status definition. Do not use pretentious vocabulary words without being nearly certain they are valid and do not use too many even if they are invoked validly. Feedback from others is to also cut out capitalisations and flow better in an outline. E.g. enumerate more other specialisations. And also separate more clearly in to a first discussion of why common is good, followed by a second discussion of why it is bad. Rewrite potentially ambiguous sentences to be more crystal method clear like... Many patients have benefitted massively from their doctors' pre-college biology studies. One may even use more Economics 101 lingo as I did in the 2nd official free mock essay. More clear examples like Berklee College Of Music [Hip Hop, Rock, Neoclassical] as well as trades like electrician, plumber, police officers, chefs, lawyers, etc. and state that I and others benefit.

Example Outlining And 1st Paragraph:

A nation should not require all of its students to study the same national curriculum until they enter college. General numeracy, literacy, history, and economics are useful. However, earlier specialization is also quite helpful. The global economy functions best when people can grow their talents and interests...

Final Conclusion Paragraph

----------

Complete drafting and perhaps essaying the entire following official collection [see afterwards for examples] prior to first sitting. Some of mine are quite weak and would benefit from feedback and perhaps being friendlier to the grader if their views differ from mine. Perhaps I ought to have practised more with my testing laptop machine in the ultimate position in my bed room seated in a bamboo viscose body building tank with the door behind me per the rules set. Simpler English. Keep It Simpler Than Simple Silly. I scored a 338|340 on my first shot and am probably content to halt there and observe my writing score. I did opt to whip out some big words like "Baccalaureate" on my final draft which did come from one of the below prompts I half prepared for:

	Governments should place few, if any, restrictions on scientific research and development.



	The best way to teach is to praise positive actions and ignore negative ones.

	The surest indicator of a great nation is represented not by the achievements of its rulers, artists, or scientists, but by the general welfare of its people.



	Teachers' salaries should be based on their students' academic performance.



	Society should make efforts to save endangered species only if the potential extinction of those species is the result of human activities.



	College students should base their choice of a field of study on the availability of jobs in that field.



	As we acquire more knowledge, things do not become more comprehensible, but more complex and mysterious.



	In any situation, progress requires discussion among people who have contrasting points of view.



	Educational institutions should dissuade students from pursuing fields of study in which they are unlikely to succeed.

	It is primarily through our identification with social groups that we define ourselves.



	College students should be encouraged to pursue subjects that interest them rather than the courses that seem most likely to lead to jobs. Claim: When planning courses, educators should take into account the interests and suggestions of their students. Reason: Students are more motivated to learn when they are interested in what they are studying.



	The greatness of individuals can be decided only by those who live after them, not by their contemporaries.



	Students should always question what they are taught instead of accepting it passively.



	The increasingly rapid pace of life today causes more problems than it solves.

	Educators should find out what students want included in the curriculum and then offer it to them.



	Educators should teach facts only after their students have studied the ideas, trends, and concepts that help explain those facts. Claim: We can usually learn much more from people whose views we share than from those whose views contradict our own. Reason: Disagreement can cause stress and inhibit learning.



	Government officials should rely on their own judgment rather than unguestioningly carry out the will of the people they serve.



	Young people should be encouraged to pursue long-term, realistic goals rather than seek immediate fame and recognition.



	The best way to teach is to praise positive actions and ignore negative ones.



	If a goal is worthy, then any means taken to attain it are justifiable.



	In order to become well-rounded individuals, all college students should be required to take courses in which they read poetry, novels, mythology, and other types of imaginative literature.



	In order for any work of art — for example, a film, a novel, a poem, or a song — to have merit, it must be understandable to most people.



	Many important discoveries or creations are accidental: it is usually while seeking the answer to one question that we come across the answer to another.



	The main benefit of the study of history is to dispel the illusion that people living now are significantly different from people who lived in earlier times.



	Learning is primarily a matter of personal discipline; students cannot be motivated by school or college alone.



	Scientists and other researchers should focus their research on areas that are likely to benefit the greatest number of people.



	Politicians should pursue common ground and reasonable consensus rather than elusive ideals.



	People should undertake risky action only after they have carefully considered its consequences.



	Leaders are created by the demands that are placed on them.



	There is little justification for society to make extraordinary efforts — especially at a great cost in money and jobs — to save endangered animal or plant species.



	The human mind will always be superior to machines because machines are only tools of human minds.



	People who are the most deeply committed to an idea or policy are also the most critical of it.



	Some people believe that society should try to save every plant and animal species, despite the expense to humans in effort, time, and financial well-being. Others believe that society heed not make extraordinary efforts, especially at a great cost in money and jobs, to save endangered species.



	Some people believe that the purpose of education is to free the mind and the spirit. Others believe that formal education tends to restrain our minds and spirits rather than set them free.



	Some people believe it is often necessary, even desirable, for political leaders to withhold information from the public. Others believe that the public has a right to be fully informed. Claim: Universities should require every student to take a variety of courses outside the student's major field of study. Reason: Acquiring knowledge of various academic disciplines is the best way to become truly educated.



	Young people should be encouraged to pursue long-term, realistic goals rather than seek immediate fame and recognition.



	Governments should not fund any scientific research whose consequences are unclear.



	Knowing about the past cannot help people to make important decisions today.



	In this age of intensive media coverage, it is ho longer possible for a society to regard any living man or woman as a hero.

	It is no longer possible for a society to regard any living man or woman as a hero.



	Some people believe that in order to thrive, a society must put its own overall success before the well-being of its individual citizens. Others believe that the well-being of a society can only be measured by the general welfare of all its people. Claim: Any piece of information referred to as a fact should be mistrusted, since it may well be proven false in the future. Reason: Much of the information that people assume is factual actually turns out to be inaccurate.



	Claim: Nations should suspend government funding for the arts when significant numbers of their citizens are hungry or unemployed. Reason: It is inappropriate — and, perhaps, even cruel — to use public resources to fund the arts when people's basic needs are not being met.



	Claim: Many problems of modern society cannot be solved by laws and the legal system. Reason: Laws cannot change what is in people's hearts or minds.



	Educators should take students’ interests into account when planning the content of the courses they teach.



	The primary goal of technological advancement should be to increase people's efficiency so that they have more leisure time.



	Educators should base their assessment of students’ learning not on students’ grasp of facts but on the ability to explain the ideas, trends, and concepts that those facts illustrate.



	Unfortunately, in contemporary society, creating an appealing image has become more important than the reality or truth behind that image.

	People's behavior is largely determined by forces not of their own making.



	Colleges and universities should require their students to spend at least one semester studying in a foreign country.



	Although innovations such as video, computers, and the Internet seem to offer schools improved methods for instructing students, these technologies all too often distract from real learning.



	Universities should require every student to take a variety of courses outside the student's field of study.



	The best ideas arise from a passionate interest in commonplace things.



	To be an effective leader, a public official must maintain the highest ethical and moral standards.



	Claim: Imagination is a more valuable asset than experience. Reason: People who lack experience are free to imagine what is possible without the constraints of established habits and attitudes.



	In most professions and academic fields, imagination is more important than knowledge.



	To be an effective leader, a public official must maintain the highest ethical and moral standards.



	Critical judgment of work in any given field has little value unless it comes from someone who is an expert in that field.



	Some people believe that scientific discoveries have given us a much better understanding of the world around us. Others believe that science has revealed to us that the world is infinitely more complex than we ever realized.



	Critical judgment of work in any given field has little value unless it comes from someone who is an expert in that field.



	In any profession — business, politics, education, government — those in power should step down after five years.



	Requiring university students to take a variety of courses outside their major fields of study is the best way to ensure that students become truly educated.



	Claim: The surest indicator of a great nation is not the achievements of its rulers, artists, or scientists. Reason: The surest indicator of a great nation is actually the welfare of all its people.



	Any leader who is quickly and easily influenced by shifts in popular opinion will accomplish little.



	Government officials should rely on their own judgment rather than unguestioningly carry out the will of the people whom they serve.



	A nation should require all of its students to study the same national curriculum until they enter college.



	It is primarily in cities that a nation's cultural traditions are generated and preserved.



	We can learn much more from people whose views we share than from people whose views contradict our own.



	When old buildings stand on ground that modern planners feel could be better used for modern purposes, modern development should be given precedence over the preservation of historic buildings.



	Claim: The surest indicator of a great nation must be the achievements of its rulers, artists, or scientists. Reason: Great achievements by a nation's rulers, artists, or scientists will ensure a good life for the majority of that nation's people.



	Some people claim that you can tell whether a nation is great by looking at the achievements of its rulers, artists, or scientists. Others argue that the surest indicator of a great nation is, in fact, the general welfare of all its people.



	The best way to understand the character of a society is to examine the character of the men and women that the society chooses as its heroes or its role models.



	All college and university students would benefit from spending at least one semester studying in a foreign country.



	Some people claim that a nation's government should preserve its wilderness areas in their natural state. Others argue that these areas should be developed for potential economic gain.



	In most professions and academic fields, imagination is more important than knowledge.



	The surest indicator of a great nation is not the achievements of its rulers, artists, or scientists, but the general well-being of all its people.



	Some people argue that successful leaders in government, industry, or other fields must be highly competitive. Other people claim that in order to be successful, a leader must be willing and able to cooperate with others.



	College students should base their choice of a field of study on the availability of jobs in that field.



	Some people believe that corporations have a responsibility to promote the well- being of the societies and environments in which they operate. Others believe that the only responsibility of corporations, provided they operate within the law, is to make as much money as possible.



	Claim: Researchers should not limit their investigations to only those areas in which they expect to discover something that has an immediate, practical application. Reason: It is impossible to predict the outcome of a line of research with any certainty.



	Some people believe that our ever-increasing use of technology significantly reduces our opportunities for human interaction. Other people believe that technology provides us with new and better ways to communicate and connect with one another.



	Claim: Knowing about the past cannot help people to make important decisions today. Reason: The world today is significantly more complex than it was even in the relatively recent past.



	Claim: Knowing about the past cannot help people to make important decisions today. Reason: We are not able to make connections between current events and past events until we have some distance from both.



	Educational institutions should actively encourage their students to choose fields of study that will prepare them for lucrative careers.



	Educational institutions should actively encourage their students to choose fields of study in which jobs are plentiful.



	Educational institutions have a responsibility to dissuade students from pursuing fields of study in which they are unlikely to succeed.



	Some people believe that competition for high grades motivates students to excel in the classroom. Others believe that such competition seriously limits the quality of real learning.

	It is more harmful to compromise one's own beliefs than to adhere to them.



	Claim: Colleges and universities should specify all required courses and eliminate elective courses in order to provide clear guidance for students. Reason: College students — like people in general — prefer to follow directions rather than make their own decisions.



	No field of study can advance significantly unless it incorporates knowledge and experience from outside that field.

	Some people claim that the goal of politics should be the pursuit of an ideal. Others argue that the goal should be finding common ground and reaching reasonable consensus.



	The best way to solve environmental problems caused by consumer-generated waste is for towns and cities to impose strict limits on the amount of trash they will accept from each household.



	We learn our most valuable lessons in life from struggling with our limitations rather than from enjoying our successes.



	Claim: While boredom is often expressed with a sense of self-satisfaction, it should really be a source of embarrassment. Reason: Boredom arises from a lack of imagination and self-motivation.



	Some people believe that the most important qualities of an effective teacher are understanding and empathy. Others believe that it is more important for teachers to be rigorous and demanding in their expectations for students.



	Claim: Though often considered an objective pursuit, learning about the historical past requires creativity. Reason: Because we can never know the past directly, we must reconstruct it by imaginatively interpreting historical accounts, documents, and artifacts.



	Claim: No act is done purely for the benefit of others. Reason: All actions — even those that seem to be done for other people — are based on self-interest.



	To understand the most important characteristics of a society, one must study its major cities.



	Educational institutions have a responsibility to dissuade students from pursuing fields of study in which they are unlikely to succeed.



	Scandals are useful because they focus our attention on problems in ways that no speaker or reformer ever could. Claim: Governments must ensure that their major cities receive the financial support they need in order to thrive. Reason: It is primarily in cities that a nation's cultural traditions are preserved and generated.



	Some people believe that government funding of the arts is necessary to ensure that the arts can flourish and be available to all people. Others believe that government funding of the arts threatens the integrity of the arts.

	People's behavior is largely determined by forces not of their own making.



	Governments should offer a free university education to any student who has been admitted to a university but who cannot afford the tuition.



	Claim: In any situation, the best way to persuade other people is to present them with facts and statistics rather than with emotional arguments. Reason: Facts are objective, so they are more persuasive than subjective appeals.



	Some people believe that success in creative fields, such as painting, fiction writing, and filmmaking, primarily requires hard work and perseverance. Others believe that such success mainly requires innate talents that cannot be learned.



	In business, education, and government, it is always appropriate to remain skeptical of new leaders until those leaders show that they are worthy of trust.



	Claim: Group assignments that students must work together to complete should replace a substantial amount of traditional lecture-based instruction in college and university courses.

	Some people believe that traveling to and living in numerous places increases one's ability to relate and connect to other people. Others believe that this ability is better cultivated by living in one place and developing a deep understanding of that community.



	Claim: Young people's tendency to make extensive use of portable devices like smartphones and tablets has hurt their development of social skills. Reason: These devices encourage users to form artificial personalities and relationships online rather than fully and honestly engaging with the people around them.



	Claim: When one is making a decision, it is better to have a limited humber of options. Reason: The more options a person has, the more difficult it is to make a rational decision.



	Because people increasingly feel compelled to share their personal details online, the right to privacy is eroding.



----------

	Governments should place few, if any, restrictions on scientific research and development.

Governments ought to place few restrictions on scientific research. This particular conundrum and related ones face biological ethicists in serious research universities. Some pain and suffering in human and animal test subjects is acceptable in the pursuit of progress. Even severe psychological damage is sometimes useful for learning more about the human condition and pharmaceutical research. Restrictions implictly counterfactually harm the billions or more who might otherwise benefit, and thus the quantitative case for less restrictions is a very compelling one.

	The best way to teach is to praise positive actions and ignore negative ones.

	The luxuries and conveniences of contemporary life prevent people from developing into truly strong and independent individuals.

The luxuries and conveniences of contemporary life enable people to develop more fully and completely in to the maximally strong and independent version of themselves. Many firms have been working hard for years on producing solid user experiences in their own partially optimized home residential environments. One may luxuriate in the heat emanating from a low-volatile organic compound heater and relax on an Apple Macintosh Book Professional machine, contemplating physics research. It is well understood by many esthetes in the medical space that "what does not kill you makes you weaker". Yet, even so, a vocal group of people still make the claim that struggling and suffering had some tangible material upside value for the individual feeling the pain. This is a dubious notion.

	In any field of inquiry, the beginner is more likely than the expert to make important contributions.

Both experts and beginners make valuable contributions all the time. Domain expertise and knowledge enable significant progress across many fields including the science, technology, engineering, mathematics bucket. The more bits and bytes one has memorized on adjacent topics, the more interesting permutations and sequences of ideas one may produce to experiment with. However, it is also true that naivete can help people spot errors or biases in deeply entrenched ways of doing things.

	The surest indicator of a great nation is represented not by the achievements of its rulers, artists, or scientists, but by the general welfare of its people.

Some would contend that overall research productivity and economic growth are stronger indicators of a nation's greatness than general welfare per se. The United States Of America has fairly mediocre education performance, and a relatively unhealthy lower class. However, it is still widely deemed by upper class folk to be a strong nation. In the modern global economy, different actors mutually benefit from trade and political power structures...

	Teachers' salaries should be based on their students' academic performance.

Teachers' salaries ought to not be based upon their students' academic performance. This leads to a fairly perverse incentive and compensation scheme around public schools nationwide. Perhaps a slight incentive function within schools could work out in a more equitable and fair way. Otherwise, under current United States Of America tax law, richer districts will keep on hiring stronger teachers. The rich will keep on growing richer in a questionably moral or economically legitimated way.

"Society" is not obligated to save endangered species. I have minimal sympathy with the vegan activist point of view on these issues. In seriously studying biological ethics, I come to conclude that animals suffer and maintaining their livelihoods necessarily involves tradeoffs with maximising human flourishing. Scientific research upon animals is helpful and useful for the human species.

	College students should base their choice of a field of study on the availability of jobs in that field.

Most college students ought to select their choice of field based around a realistic read on the labor market. Unless they intend to hustle on the side with various minor gigs whilst pursuing entrepreneurship, it is economically wise and prudent to respond to incentives in this market. Currently, there exist many whiny debt-laden undergraduate degree holders angry with employers for not simply hiring them. But they hold degrees which are relatively useless to the firms!

	As we acquire more knowledge, things do not become more comprehensible, but more complex and mysterious.

Knowledge often leads to empowerment. Many things become more comprehensible. And yet mysteries sprout up and remain where previous ones disappeared. It is common for people to have a more accurate model of reality as they age from 0 to 25 years old. Most are better able to predict the future and contemplate economically relevant tasks. However, especially for researchers and entrepreneurs, staying ahead of the curve and searching for the next big insights is an omnipresent drive.

	In any situation, progress requires discussion among people who have contrasting points of view.

Progress does not require discussion from people who have contrasting points of view. While many historical examples of useful insights have common from university research settings, there also exists a strong track record of entrepreneurship and independent thinkers generating value. Dialogical debate has its own place of value in educational and other settings, but trend setting designers and esthetes have paved their own paths through our physical reality and created "the future".

	Educational institutions should dissuade students from pursuing fields of study in which they are unlikely to succeed.

Schools and universities should ensure to inform students if success is very questionable. The way this can happen is via instructors or advisers realistically consulting labour markets and Grade Point Averages during the 2nd and 3rd years of undergraduate degree programs. This is a good faith way to produce written records so that a disgruntled and indebted graduate will not claim recourse or antipathy towards the instutition for perceived failure.

Economics 101 Incentives And Pressures.

	Governments should not fund any scientific research whose consequences are unclear.

Governments can fund scientific research, even if the consequences are unclear. More strongly, biological ethicists may support research programs with substantive downside risks, if the perceived expected benefits are larger. There is an onus on regulators and the bureaucracy to estimate these quantities, which can be tricky.

	Society should identify those children who have special talents and provide training for them at an early age to develop their talents.

Society ought to develop especially talented children. Even if talent is nontrivially a product of parental wealth, it is still in the overall interest of economic and research productivity to provide such training. There exists a solid evidential basis that such a policy helps such kids.

	It is primarily through our identification with social groups that we define ourselves.

We define ourselves in different ways. Many hard working people largely identify with their work and firm. Or, if they are creators, perhaps they might define themself through the beneficiaries of their output. A doctor might identify with their concrete set of patients. And a stay at home mother might love their offspring very much.

	College students should be encouraged to pursue subjects that interest them rather than the courses that seem most likely to lead to jobs.

College students ought to have an adviser who is in touch with labour markets. This way, they can mutually plan out a reasonable sequence of courses which will be interesting, but also productive. Many modern universities have structures in place for electives and minors, so students can choose favorite auxiliary topics of study. Put simply and tautologically, the economy grows when students are encouraged to pursue courses which seem most likely to lead to jobs. However, passion projects sometimes turn in to valuable entrepreneurs.

Entrepreneurs and passion. Creator economy. Side hustles and bustles and people who work multiple small jobs to eke by.

Ongoing class separation problems in United States Of America and worldwide.

	Claim: When planning courses, educators should take into account the interests and suggestions of their students. Reason: Students are more motivated to learn when they are interested in what they are studying.

Similar to previous shtick on universities having advisers who know things about the modern labour market at the very least.

	The greatness of individuals can be decided only by those who live after them, not by their contemporaries.

The greatness of individuals can be decided by those who live during their time. In many cases, those people are the primary beneficiaries of their work. An inventor whose technology benefitted people but has since been obsoleted, for example, might be underappreciated by modern humans. Nevertheless, we could discover appreciation for their "greatness" in the praise of contemporaries.

	Students should always question what they are taught instead of accepting it passively.

Students have finite time and energy. Thus, it is reasonable to memorise much information, and question some of it deeply. But, there should always be some skepticism and inquiry.

Simple toy example relating to laundry washing and why H2O2 and boiling in passivated stainless steel may be acceptable and even a strong preference for some people. Status quo bias and automaticity versus overcoming status quo bias.

The value of memorising large corpora. Knowing what is going on in the research world broadly without attempting to dive deeply in to multiple avenues of research. Lawyers moving fast and producing what they need to without questioning everything too deeply. I do not know. Mediocre topic frankly. I am lazy.

	The increasingly rapid pace of life today causes more problems than it solves.

A primary modern problem, with rapid technology like the TikTok application, is a less educated populus. Furthermore, most people lack motivation and interest in reading textbooks comprehensively. The art of completionism and robust general knowledge is fading rather quickly. In particular, it would seem to me as though large swathes of American society lack a strong model of Science 101 and Biology 101. Many semi-fraudulent trends have been propagated by such mobile device applications, and firms have profited from ignorance and misinformation.

TikTok. InstaGram. Tumblr. Can bring up the harm causing nature of pro-anorexia content and so on and so on.

Discuss the environmental impact of Amazon Prime and general trash, human growth, animal agriculture, etc. usual kind of environmental shtick on global warming and climate change.

Culture war. Incentivises kids to become uneducated troll content generators rather than highly educated deep thinker contemplators. Somewhat perverse looking perhaps from an Economics 101 perspective.

	Claim: It is no longer possible for a society to regard any living man or woman as a hero. Reason: The reputation of anyone who is subjected to media scrutiny will eventually be diminished.

A society can still regard living people as heroes. With more data tracking in modernity, minor negative parts of people's lives are tracked. However, unique stellar individuals still shine. If someone still seems like a moral paragon, then it logically follows that evidentially they may be even more virtuous than exemplars of the past. Some of my personal favourite examples get negative press anyways.

Jeff Bezos. Bill Gates. The Giving Pledge. Judith Faulkner. Effective Altruism thought leaders. Criticisms of all of these individuals.

More ongoing controversies in the general biological ethics space. Male Genital Mutilation. Judeo-Christian woo poetry and other forms of woo poems. Antitheism and protheism.

	Competition for high grades seriously limits the quality of learning at all levels of education.

Others believe that the well-being of a society can only be measured by the general welfare of all its people. Claim: Any piece of information referred to as a fact should be mistrusted, since it may well be proven false in the future. Reason: Much of the information that people assume is factual actually turns out to be inaccurate.



	Claim: Nations should suspend government funding for the arts when significant numbers of their citizens are hungry or unemployed. Reason: It is inappropriate — and, perhaps, even cruel — to use public resources to fund the arts when people's basic needs are not being met.



	Claim: Many problems of modern society cannot be solved by laws and the legal system. Reason: Laws cannot change what is in people's hearts or minds.



	Educators should take students’ interests into account when planning the content of the courses they teach.



	The primary goal of technological advancement should be to increase people's efficiency so that they have more leisure time.



	Educators should base their assessment of students’ learning not on students’ grasp of facts but on the ability to explain the ideas, trends, and concepts that those facts illustrate.
