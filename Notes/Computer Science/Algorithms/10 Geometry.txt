Shoelace Formula For Polygon Area: n
	Sum of x[i] * y[i+1] - x[i+1] * y[i].

Pick's Theorem For Polygon Area:
	Lattice Points.
	Area = Interior + Boundary / 2 - 1.

Minimum Pair Distance In Points-Set: n log n

Convex Hull Of Points-Set: n log n
	Sort radially from e.g. minimum y-coordinate point and then process in order.

Integrals
	Canonical algorithms.

Inclusion In Convex Hull Interiors
	Check inequalities. Or say call line container and evaluate at x-value for in range.

Intersection Points

Points Class
	See Notebook from KACTL C++.
