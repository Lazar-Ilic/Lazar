Trie Insert And Find: n
	B-A-N-A-L
		  `N-A
	    `T-E-R

Hashing: n
	Rolling polynomial hashing for substring subvector equivalence etc.
	
	Random values assignment to characters|values sum of direct linear monomial terms instead of polynomial rolling hash in map for sum over substring subvector multiplicity equivalence etc.
	Can double hash to decrease P[collision]

Prefix Function/String Match: n + m
	Prefix Function for ABACABA one obtains 0010123 is the length of the longest nonidentical prefix which is also a suffix of as[0, 1, ..., i].

Strings Match: m + n + p

Max Prefix Matched From Index: n
	For ABACABA one obtains 0010301.

Max Palindromes: n
	The maximal size of palindrome centered at each index.

Min Rotation: n
	Finds the lexicographically smallest rotation.

Suffix And Least Common Prefix Array: n log n
	For example, for BAABA one obtains that the suffixes sorted lexicographically including the trivial empty suffix are:

	A
	AABA
	ABA
	BA
	BAABA
	The Suffix Arrray is 541230 indices of suffixes in original string.
	And the Least Common Prefix Array is [0]01102 representing the mutual prefix match length between consecutive suffixes.

Suffix Trie: n

Checking For Reverse And Cyclic Strings:
	Can consider usefully appending as + reverse(all(as)) or as + as, as + bs + cs, etc.

Longest Common Subsequence: a * b
	Dynamic Programming.

Is Longest Common Subsequence Complete Length Of b?: a
	Direct maximal out bash recursion.

Does A Length a Interval of a+a Contain Complete b Subsequence: a * b
	Direct maximal out bash recursion each relevant subinterval. ? Better exists.

-------------

Type Printer: n
	Trie and Depth First Search through being sure to end on longest string by entering those vertices last.

Number Of Strings In Set With Certain Prefix: n
	Auxiliary to trie, size of subtree of vertex.

Rareville:
	Similar, key idea is auxiliary to trie useful.

Hash Of Substring After n Preprocessing: 1

Substring Range Matching:
	Hash the dictionary. Note that the [Sum Of Lengths] <= 20000 condition implies the number of distinct lengths is <= ~sqrt[20000] ~ 140 means i.e. sorting queries on length of S followed by standard interval processing for queries.

Observation On Division
	Note that floor[n/a] can take on O[sqrt[n]]=O[n^[1/2]] distinct values over all positive integers a. As in particular the hitting set might be like some dudes in [sqrt[n],n] for a in [1,sqrt[n]] and hitting set [1,sqrt[n]] for a in [sqrt[n],n] with multiplicities.

Max Palindromes Around All Indices: n

Min Rotation: n

String Match: n
	To find matches of "LOL" in "LOLOL" one runs Prefix Function on string "LOL#LOLOL" and obtains 001012323 i.e. 3s map to instances and indices of occurrences map to indices of final character in original string.

Longest Common Substring: mn
	Dynamic Program max[LCS[a][b-1], LCS[a-1][b]] or 1 + LCS[a-1][b-1] if as[a] == bs[b].
