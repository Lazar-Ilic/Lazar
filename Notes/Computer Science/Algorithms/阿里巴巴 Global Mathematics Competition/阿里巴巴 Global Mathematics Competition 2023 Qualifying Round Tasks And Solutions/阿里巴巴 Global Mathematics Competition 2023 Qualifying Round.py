# Could write up a checker to confirm ensure that there exists no uh path of length 18 on a 5x5 which actually does induce hitting each uh vertex uh. Uh this is half interesting I mean uh the actual truth here is that uh there are very few uh [25 choose 18] = [25 choose 7] is like very small we could bash every single such subset and check if it is or is not even a path and then check if it satisfies the desideratum and terminates adjacently but I think the answer there is a uh no. Which is somewhat strong partial evidence for the claim that 49 on a 9x9 10x10 is impossible too and so 50<=X<90 B was the Right answer for that task.

# Strongly suggests strong experimental evidence that the answer is B n=32 credence > 0.8 frankly upon updating on this Output. OKOKOK off the dome Right here the Simple Statistics of this scenario is that this is actually very very very strong evidence to reject that hypothesis in fact the Probability of this observation on a relatively reasonable prior leads to a negligible posterior and in fact I do think curve fitting might lowkey work here bashing like 200 rather than 30 say and curve fitting... up to 1st 2nd 3rd order Taylor Series Polynomial expression can work in some kind of a ad hoc workplace scenarios with simulations.
