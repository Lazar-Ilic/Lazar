Upon reading the official Guidance .pdf file I updated the strategy is to keep the monitour tab open in full screen mode during the whole round while leaving 0. And clearly using a robust external camera to show clean pencil and paper upon standing desk setup. Type LaTeX in directly rapidly towards the end of the round and render it in their environment. Consider copying and pasting in to local files at the very end in the final minutes prior to a final submission so that way there is 0 Red flags for suspicious activity and one is in the clear In The Money.

Thank you for the invitation(/ω＼)

In fact, I have no say in this issue (⊙x⊙;)

I have loved Mathematical Olympiad since I was a child, and I have gained a lot of friendship, happiness, confidence and growth because of Mathematical Olympiad, so I am very grateful to Mathematical Olympiad. I was not happy in elementary school for various reasons. My only friends were from the Mathematical Olympiad class . I felt that attending the Mathematical Olympiad extracurricular class was just like playing. Later in junior high school, I used the Mathematical Olympiad class. There are some, but not many.

But I don’t know to what extent the above situation is true for everyone. Many times I feel that primary school Mathematical Olympiads can indeed exercise certain thinking skills and numerical skills. Looking back now, students who are good at the Mathematical Olympiad in elementary school may have good future prospects, but it is not clear whether the function of the Mathematical Olympiad lies in training or selection.

To be fair, it would be a dereliction of duty on the part of parents to force children who don't like mathematics to learn Olympiad mathematics that exceeds their abilities. It would be very irresponsible to force children to learn Mathematical Olympiads after they try and fail and communicate reasonably if they come to inappropriate conclusions. Many parents neither solve the problem of their children's incomprehensibility in class nor suspend classes, which harms the parent-child relationship and their children's self-confidence at the same time.

Therefore, if Mathematical Olympiad is understood as a partial expansion of mathematics, it is very good to learn it on the basis of understanding, and it is helpful for mathematical thinking . But if parents neither solve the problem of their children’s incomprehension in class (encourage the children to ask the teacher and discuss it) nor suspend the class, that would be stupid~

谢谢邀请(/ω＼)

其实我在这个问题没有什么发言权(⊙x⊙;)

我自己从小很喜欢奥数，也因为奥数获得了很多友情，快乐，自信和成长，所以我自己还是很感谢奥数的。我小学在校内因为种种原因过的并不开心，唯一的几个朋友都是奥数班认识的，我自己的感觉当时去上奥数课外班就像玩一样～后来初中的时候，用到奥数的地方也有一些，但是其实并不多。

但是上述情况对于大家有多少程度成立其实我不大清楚。很多时候我觉得小学奥数确实可以锻炼某些思维能力和数字技巧。现在回想起来，小学奥数学的好的同学未来发展有可能确实不错，但是奥数功能究竟在于锻炼还是选拔尚不清楚。

讲道理，逼不喜欢数学的孩子学习超过自身能力的奥数是家长的失职。在孩子尝试，失败之后合理沟通如果得出了不合适的结论，再逼迫孩子学习奥数非常不负责任。很多家长既不解决孩子上课听不懂的问题，也不停课，那就是同时伤害亲子关系和孩子的自信心。

所以，奥数若理解为数学的部分拓展，理解的基础上学习它非常好，对于数学思维有帮助。但是如果家长既不解决孩子上课听不懂的问题（鼓励孩子问老师，讨论），也不停课，那就很蠢啦～

The 2023 Alibaba Global Mathematics Competition has concluded with 250,000 entries for the fifth edition
2023/09/16
On the evening of September 16, the list of winners of the 2023 Alibaba Global Mathematics Competition was officially released. Qu Xiaoyu, Li Yixiao, Hao Tianze, and Zhang Shengtong won the gold medal. Their average age is only 22 years old. They have extraordinary talents, love mathematics and love life even more. The Ali Mathematics Competition has been held for five consecutive years and is becoming a shining stage to discover new stars in mathematics, with more than ten new generation mathematicians emerging.



Qu Xiaoyu is the youngest perfect gold medal winner in the history of the Ali Mathematics Competition. He is only 17 years old and is currently a sophomore at Peking University. But this Chongqing boy admits that he is not a genius: "I am not very good at mathematics. The more I learn mathematics, the more I feel that I don't understand too much and I am very insignificant." Mathematics and piano are Qu Xiaoyu's favorite things. In his opinion, mathematics is wonderful. He is an art, and the piano is his passion. Playing the piano for 30-40 minutes every day is his happiest time. Qu Xiaoyu's piano skills have reached amateur performance level, and his favorite pianist is Bach.

Gold medalist Zhang Shengtong, a doctoral student at Stanford University, also became famous at a young age. During his undergraduate period, he solved a problem that has troubled the mathematics community for 70 years. The paper was published in the top journal "Annals of Mathematics". This is his fifth time participating in the competition. He has won the silver medal four times in a row. , finally won the gold medal this year, and my dream came true. Another gold medal contestant, Hao Tianze, is currently a doctoral student in mathematics at Peking University. He has the outgoing personality of a Northeasterner and the introverted mathematician. He hides his identity as a joker and gave a talk show at the awards ceremony.

On the same day, the awards ceremony also welcomed a special contestant. Lou Yingen, a 20-year-old Chinese teenager with ALS, won the Excellence Award. His body is confined to a wheelchair, but his will and mind are far superior to ordinary people. He has a wide range of interests. He likes to watch Federer play tennis, listen to Wang Feng's songs, and recently completed his first surfing in his life. Lou Yingen is currently studying physics and mathematics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, studying under Alan Guth, a famous theoretical physicist and founder of the cosmological inflation model. Alan Guth once worked with Hawking. He believes that Lou Yingen and Hawking are very similar. They are extremely talented and both have amazing enthusiasm and optimism about life and scientific research.

"Although I have never taken a step on this planet, I can soar in the rich and magnificent mathematical universe. If I can understand the language of the universe, why should I worry about the limitations of my body?" Lou Yingen's on-site remarks , causing warm applause.



It is a tradition in the mathematics world that young geniuses emerge in large numbers, and the young people who emerged in the Ali Mathematics Competition have broken the stereotype of being boring and depressed, showing a rich and diverse new atmosphere of the times. Mathematics is their A-side, including piano and talk shows. , surfing, two-dimensional, ancient style and other hobbies are their B-sides. The Ali Mathematics Competition has also accompanied the growth of these teenagers, witnessing their talent and enthusiasm to promote the development of mathematics. Since the Ali Mathematics Competition was held for five years, a large number of new generation mathematicians have emerged, who have made great achievements on the road of research. With recognized academic contributions, more than ten people have obtained teaching positions in first-class universities around the world.

Engage in professional research. "A generation of mathematicians has a mission, and I look forward to your rising talents." said Tian Gang, chairman of the Chinese Mathematical Society and academician of the Chinese Academy of Sciences.

Associate Professor Su Weijie of the University of Pennsylvania is the first Silver Medal winner. He is currently engaged in cross-research on mathematics and computers. He has made important contributions in the field of machine learning and has won the Sloan Research Award and other awards. "There is a feeling of an old boy dreaming back to his youth." Su Weijie has been participating in this competition for several years, first as a contestant, and then as a teacher of the proposition group. He turned cutting-edge topics in the industry such as deep learning and large language models into test questions, hoping that the competition It not only reflects the interest of mathematics, but also reflects the connection with the real world.

Xia Mingtao, a new assistant professor at the Courant Institute of Mathematics at New York University, has also experienced an identity transformation from a contestant to a public question maker. His other identity is the UP host of Station B. In May of this year, he broadcast his doctoral defense live on Station B, hoping to use more popular language to inspire everyone's enthusiasm for mathematics. "The Ali Mathematics Competition has continued throughout my doctoral career and has given me a lot of inspiration, including promoting mathematics through the Internet."

"We present awards to contestants who have achieved outstanding results, and we also pay tribute to everyone who loves mathematics. You have shown the infinite charm and possibilities of mathematics." Zhang Jianfeng, president of Alibaba Damo Academy, said that mathematics is the foundation of science and its value is endless. It’s about the day and night, but it’s about the future. Sun Lijun, chairman of the Alibaba Charity Foundation, said: "We hope that this public welfare event, the Ali Mathematics Competition, can inspire everyone's enthusiasm for mathematics and basic scientific research, and encourage more people to love and devote themselves to scientific research." It is understood that Alibaba has been actively involved in scientific research in recent years. Continue to increase investment in scientific research and promote core technology breakthroughs and basic scientific research progress through scientific and technological public welfare, patent opening, and scientific research cooperation.

The Alibaba Global Mathematics Competition is famous for its no registration threshold and interesting questions. It has attracted more than 250,000 participants from more than 70 countries and regions around the world. It has become the world's largest online mathematics competition and the whole society's enthusiasm for mathematics. is being lit.

5届吸引25万人次参赛 2023阿里巴巴全球数学竞赛落幕
2023/09/16
9月16日傍晚，2023阿里巴巴全球数学竞赛获奖名单正式出炉，瞿霄宇、李一笑、郝天泽、张盛桐荣获金奖，他们平均年龄仅为22岁，有着不凡的天赋，热爱数学也更热爱生活。阿里数学竞赛已连续举办五届，正在成为发掘数学新星的闪亮舞台，走出了十余名新生代数学家。



瞿霄宇是阿里数学竞赛有史以来最年轻的满分金奖得主，年仅17岁，目前已在北京大学就读大二。但这名重庆少年自认并非天才：“我很菜，数学越学越觉得不懂的太多了，自己很渺小。”数学和钢琴是瞿霄宇最喜欢的东西，在他来看，数学是美妙的艺术，而钢琴是心事托付，每天弹琴30-40分钟，是他最快乐的时光。瞿霄宇的钢琴水平已达到业余表演级，最喜欢的钢琴家是巴赫。

金奖选手、斯坦福大学博士生张盛桐同样年少成名，本科期间就解出困扰数学界70年的难题，论文发表于顶级期刊《数学年刊》，这是他第五次参赛，此前四次连摘银奖，今年终于夺金，梦想成真。另一位金奖选手郝天泽目前是北大数学博士生，性格兼具东北人的外放与数学家的内敛，隐藏身份是一名段子手，在颁奖现场讲起了脱口秀。

当天，颁奖礼还迎来一位特别选手，20岁的华裔渐冻症少年楼印根获得优秀奖。他身体被禁锢在轮椅上，意志与头脑却远胜常人，兴趣广泛，喜欢看费德勒打网球、听汪峰的歌，最近还完成了人生的第一次冲浪。楼印根目前在麻省理工学院学习物理和数学，师从著名理论物理学家、宇宙学暴胀模型创立者阿兰·古斯。阿兰·古斯曾和霍金共事，他认为楼印根和霍金很像，天赋超群，还都对生活和科研保有令人惊讶的热情和乐观。

“尽管我从未在这个星球上迈出过一步，但我可以在丰富而宏伟的数学宇宙中翱翔。如果我能理解宇宙的语言，我为什么要担心身体的局限？”楼印根的现场感言，引起热烈掌声。



少年天才辈出，是数学界的传统，而阿里数学竞赛上涌现的少年们，他们打破了枯燥、苦闷的刻板印象，展现出丰富多元的时代新气息，数学是他们的A面，钢琴、脱口秀、冲浪、二次元、古风等爱好是他们的B面。而阿里数学竞赛也伴随这些少年成长，见证他们用天赋和热情推动数学向前发展，阿里数学竞赛举办五届以来，走出一大批新生代数学家，他们在研究的道路上初露峥嵘，做出了公认的学术贡献，已有十余人在全球一流高校获得教职，

从事专业研究。“一代数学人有一代数学人的使命，期待冉冉升起的你们。”中国数学会理事长、中国科学院院士田刚表示。

宾夕法尼亚大学副教授苏炜杰是首届银奖得主，目前从事数学和计算机交叉研究，在机器学习领域做出重要贡献，曾获斯隆研究奖等奖项。“有一种老男孩梦回青春的感觉。”苏炜杰数年持续参加这项赛事，先是选手，后是命题组老师，他把深度学习、大语言模型等工业界的前沿课题转变为试题，希望竞赛不光能体现数学的趣味，还要体现与真实世界的关联。

纽约大学柯朗数学研究所新晋助理教授夏铭涛，也经历了从参赛选手到大众出题人的身份转变，他另一重身份是B站UP主。今年5月，他在B站全程直播他的博士答辩，希望借此以更通俗的语言，激发大家对数学的热情。“阿里数学竞赛贯穿我的博士生涯，给了我很多启发，包括通过网络宣传数学。”

“我们向取得优异成绩的选手颁奖，更向热爱数学的每一个人致敬，你们展现了数学的无限魅力和可能。”阿里巴巴达摩院院长张建锋说，数学是科学的基础，其价值不在于朝夕，而关乎未来。阿里巴巴公益基金会理事长孙利军表示：“希望阿里数学竞赛这项公益赛事，能激发大家对于数学和基础科研的热情，鼓励更多人热爱科研、投身科研。”据了解，阿里巴巴近年来持续加大科研投入，并通过科技公益、专利开放和科研合作等方式，推动核心技术突破与基础科研进步。
