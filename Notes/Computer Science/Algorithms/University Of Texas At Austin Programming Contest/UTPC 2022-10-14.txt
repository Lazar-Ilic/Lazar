"My fingers movin' so fast I'll set the place ablaze." So for the first time in recent memory I did crack and AC ABC with 0 errors in < 10 minutes is pretty chill and then onsighted some other tasks. Should have perhaps opted to use a vector of strings rather than a vector of vector of ints or converted into an even lower memory usage data storage memory format such as straight up 2 bits in a bitset on task F also could have opted to not actually stored the distance from root node vertex for each pair location instead opting to do the usual vector of pairs based Breadth First Search approach simply storing each Breadth First Search Level distance in 1 variable there for less memory usage. Of course in task I an onsight would be that a 1 implies a 1 and 1 and any in row and column are then forced as well as some insights related to the factorisation of Greatest Common Divisors potentially but the real meaty point I think is that we can intra row intra column create a graph and at the end literally like ratio out Depth First Search to solve out for potential variables maybe but this is classical canonical stuff almost certainly?
