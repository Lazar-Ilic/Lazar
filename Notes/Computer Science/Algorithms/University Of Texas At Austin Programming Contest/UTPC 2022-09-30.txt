Well I maybe should come back and fully upsolve every single task of course latency at night was shitty and also dudes and girls were screaming all night Friday Saturday nights are the worst on the street next to my current shitty cribbo and so that was that. You can use a simple like set of pairs of ints works on that task where the input was not sorted like you can multiplicity count with an unordered map too works and call size on that do a 2 pointers approach. Also the actual Breadth First Search on that other task can try to shtick the shtick in place like I did without any uh auxiliary vector of vector of booleans memory usage but instead by like checking a directional forced direction shtick but anyways you can also just do a processed thus far vector of vector of booleans will work for AC there man I was slow.
