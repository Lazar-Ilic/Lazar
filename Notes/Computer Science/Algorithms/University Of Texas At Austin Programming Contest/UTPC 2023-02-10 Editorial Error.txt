It would seem to me that the provided solution to G is in fact incorrect and Wrong [see my C++ file on that topic for more details] and thus in particular I ought to have been awarded Rank 4 in front of stan243456 Ruocheng Stanley Wei upon that particular contest. I would think the tasks composers for UTPC often botch them as well as task statements frankly that one from Michelle on the 2023-01 contest on the integral of the parabola Deltas used "radius" incorrectly when a "radius" has to do with the locus of points within a distance r from another point. Oh gee Yikes I misread the task statement again oh OK so in this case it was supposed to be that trivial radial direction case well OK then a Loss is a Loss fair and square and I should have trill drilled it and J in round as well to be sure.
