Seems OK analyses from the competitors post facto. I will potentially be hopping in the mixture on this round and all future AtCoder Heuristic rounds too depending upon my free time. Seems potentially fun and valuable and useful to get my hands dirty with some C codes and actual relevant topical approximation algorithms for distributed computational systems promoted by legitimate top firms worldwide.
