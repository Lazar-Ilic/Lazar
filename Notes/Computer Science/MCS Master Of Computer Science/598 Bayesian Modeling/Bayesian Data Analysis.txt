List of models



List of examples

Fascinating list of examples. I would not know how simple or complex my own .BAM file information from the Invitae firm will be. Think maybe some boring lames there and chicks like Claudia Feng or whatever do lame lowbrow statistics on genetics they would contend was midbrow and relevant, topical, errrm, or whatever ugh. Anyways I think it is interesting I spiked double carrier for Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia... unclear what took place during my life history and ages from 11 to 16 so who can be too sure really with only image files and no good clear sensitive serum assays or whatever... fascinating stuff you know cortisol and adrenalin perceptions.

A lot of interesting topics here actually. One of the most commonly cited statistics I see in common public news is the one about how training for the SAT does not really boost scores all too much... interesting stuff the Dr. Scott Alexander Siskind writing on these Ashkenazi Jewish et al. notions of general intelligence etc. etc. and hopefully my own upcoming GRE Graduate Record Examination General 340+6.0 I hope...

Fascinating list of topics frankly inspires me again to review now I have more critical reading in general scientific corpora I feel this is a solid introductory book. I should look for more textbooks to add to this folder to read through too. And more GitHubs.
