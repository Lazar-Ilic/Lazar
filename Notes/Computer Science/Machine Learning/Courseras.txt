Uh yeah I have a ton fully scraped and saved locally and there exist many GitHub repositories full of labs and ideas for them. I really was very careful to parse my way through some and ace all of the quizzes as well as eyeball a variety of TensorFlow implementations. I gonna say this is a huge corpus will probably take me a few weeks or months to fully process through but has some good solid strong mid brow content rising well beyond basic stochastic calculus and reinforcement learning in parts into nontrivial interesting territory.
