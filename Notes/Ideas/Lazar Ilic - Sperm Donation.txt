Adventurous: Hiking the Kalalau Trail in Kauai, Hawaii as a child. It was an uncontrived setting in which to feel the fear of death over the Pacific Ocean, listen to the waves, and gaze upon the Milky Way. A mountain lion meowing and big bears were awesome on the Lakes Trail near Alta Peak at Sequoia National Park. A hypoxia headache walking up towards the Caltech Submillimeter Observatory on Mauna Kea is notable too, as this is where Sonmi-451, and later Zachry, ascended in Cloud Atlas.
[?] Staff Impressions: Quiet. Simple. Pleasant but aloof.
Express Yourself:
Periodic Circles
This problem involves an iterative procedure that begins with a circle of n >= 3 integers. At each step every number is simultaneously replaced with the absolute difference of its two neighbours. For any initial values, the procedure eventually becomes periodic. Let S[N] be the sum of all possible periods for 3 <= n <= N. For example, S[6] = 6, because the possible periods for 3 <= n <= 6 are 1, 2, 3. Specifically, n = 3 and n = 4 can each have period 1 only, while n = 5 can have period 1 or 3, and n = 6 can have period 1 or 2. You are also given S[30] = 20381. Find S[100].

Analysis Details
Chlamydia Negative - Bacteria Not Detected
This test was looking for chlamydia trachomatis, the bacteria that causes chlamydia infection, in your urine sample. We did not find chlamydia bacteria in your urine sample. This means it's unlikely that you have a chlamydia infection.
Gonorrhea Negative - Bacteria Not Detected
This test was looking for neisseria gonorrhoeae, the bacteria that causes gonorrhea infection, in your urine sample. We did not find gonorrhea bacteria in your urine sample. This means it's unlikely that you have a gonorrhea infection.
Hepatitis B Negative - Antigens Not Detected
This test was looking for hepatitis B surface antigens, a protein found on the surface of the hepatitis B virus. We did not find hepatitis B antigens in your blood sample. This means it's unlikely that you have hepatitis B. If you haven't already, consider getting a hepatitis B vaccination to prevent future infection.
Hepatitis C Negative -Antibodies Not Detected
This test was looking for antibodies [immune cells] produced in response to the hepatitis C virus. We did not find hepatitis C antibodies in your blood sample. This means it's unlikely that you have hepatitis C.
HIV Negative - Antigens Or Antibodies Not Detected
This test was looking for several things in your blood sample: HIV p24 antigen, a protein found inside the human immunodeficiency virus [HIV]. Antibodies [immune cells] produced in response to the presence of HIV types 1 or 2. We did not find HIV 1/2 antigens or antibodies in your blood sample. This means it's unlikely that you have HIV 1 or 2. If you have a partner with HIV or have regular unprotected sex, consider talking to your doctor about pre-exposure prophylaxis [PrEP], a medication that can reduce your chances of contracting HIV.
Syphilis Negative - Antibodies Not Detected
This test was looking for antibodies [immune cells] produced in response to treponema pallidum, the bacteria that causes syphilis. We did not find T. pallidum antibodies in your blood sample. This means it's unlikely that you have a syphilis infection.
