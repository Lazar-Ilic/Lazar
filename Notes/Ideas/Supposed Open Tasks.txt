Perhaps soon I will even consider providing potentially interesting follow on readings in the literature for books and papers related to these tasks, for now a little reading on powerful triplets task. I might tank more time and try and drum up something beautiful here secure the bag as a Quantitative Researcher rather than a Software Engineer see and navigate optionalities.

OK so uh there exist many lists:

From Quora Jeff Erickson:

There are thousands, if not millions, of open problems in computer science. Here are a dozen or so off the top of my head.

Can problems solvable with little space be solved quickly? (Does P = PSPACE?)

Does randomness actually speed up computation? (Does RP=P? BPP=P?)

How much does exploiting quantum computing actually speed up computing? (We know that it has some effect, because of Grover’s algorithm, but how much? Does BQP=P?)

	Erdos-Mollin-Walsh Conjecture

	Erdos tasks.

	Minimum Area Triangles

Given a set of n points in the plane, we can find the minimum area triangle in quadratic time, but the best known lower bound is only Omega(n log n). Find a subquadratic algorithm, or prove a quadratic lower bound in any model of computation.

	Anchored Rectangles

Suppose we want to pack a unit square with non-overlapping rectangles that have sides parallel to the axes. The catch is that the lower left corners of all the rectangles are given. By the way, such rectangles are called anchored. Now, given some points in the unit square, aka the lower left corners, we want to find anchored rectangles with the maximum total area.

Increasing Permutation
When the given points are close to the right upper corner of the square, the total area is small. When a single point is in the bottom left corner of the square, we can cover the whole square. The problem becomes more interesting if we add one extra assumption: one of the given points has to be the bottom left corner of the square. In the 1960’s, it was conjectured by Allen Freedman that any set of points has an anchored rectangle packing with the area of at least one half. The problem is quite resistant. In 2011, Dumitrescu and Tóth showed that every set of points has a packing of area at least 0.09, which was the first constant bound found, and is the best bound currently known.

	Enumerate Self Avoiding Walks

A self avoiding walk is a sequence of moves on a lattice not visiting the same point more than once. What is the number of self avoiding walks from [0,0] to [n-1,n-1] in an nxn grid, taking steps from [0,1], [0,-1], [1,0], [-1,0]?
