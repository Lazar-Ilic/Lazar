Millennium Prize Problems
Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture
Hodge conjecture
Navier‚ÄìStokes existence and smoothness
P versus NP problem
Poincar√© conjecture (solved)
Riemann hypothesis
Yang‚ÄìMills existence and mass gap

The Millennium Prize Problems are seven well-known complex mathematical problems selected by the Clay Mathematics Institute in 2000. The Clay Institute has pledged a US$1 million prize for the first correct solution to each problem.

The Clay Mathematics Institute officially designated the title Millennium Problem for the seven unsolved mathematical problems, the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture, Hodge conjecture, Navier‚ÄìStokes existence and smoothness, P versus NP problem, Riemann hypothesis, Yang‚ÄìMills existence and mass gap, and the Poincar√© conjecture at the Millennium Meeting held on May 24, 2000. Thus, on the official website of the Clay Mathematics Institute, these seven problems are officially called the Millennium Problems.

To date, the only Millennium Prize problem to have been solved is the Poincar√© conjecture. The Clay Institute awarded the monetary prize to Russian mathematician Grigori Perelman in 2010. However, he declined the award as it was not also offered to Richard S. Hamilton, upon whose work Perelman built.

Overview
The Clay Institute was inspired by a set of twenty-three problems organized by the mathematician David Hilbert in 1900 which were highly influential in driving the progress of mathematics in the twentieth century.[1] The seven selected problems span a number of mathematical fields, namely algebraic geometry, arithmetic geometry, geometric topology, mathematical physics, number theory, partial differential equations, and theoretical computer science. Unlike Hilbert's problems, the problems selected by the Clay Institute were already renowned among professional mathematicians, with many actively working towards their resolution.[2]

The seven problems were officially announced by John Tate and Michael Atiyah during a ceremony held on May 24, 2000 (at the amphith√©√¢tre Marguerite de Navarre) in the Coll√®ge de France in Paris.[3]

Grigori Perelman, who had begun work on the Poincar√© conjecture in the 1990s, released his proof in 2002 and 2003. His refusal of the Clay Institute's monetary prize in 2010 was widely covered in the media. The other six Millennium Prize Problems remain unsolved, despite a large number of unsatisfactory proofs by both amateur and professional mathematicians.

Andrew Wiles, as part of the Clay Institute's scientific advisory board, hoped that the choice of US$1 million prize money would popularize, among general audiences, both the selected problems as well as the "excitement of mathematical endeavor".[4] Another board member, Fields medalist Alain Connes, hoped that the publicity around the unsolved problems would help to combat the "wrong idea" among the public that mathematics would be "overtaken by computers".[5]

Some mathematicians have been more critical. Anatoly Vershik characterized their monetary prize as "show business" representing the "worst manifestations of present-day mass culture", and thought that there are more meaningful ways to invest in public appreciation of mathematics.[6] He viewed the superficial media treatments of Perelman and his work, with disproportionate attention being placed on the prize value itself, as unsurprising. By contrast, Vershik praised the Clay Institute's direct funding of research conferences and young researchers. Vershik's comments were later echoed by Fields medalist Shing-Tung Yau, who was additionally critical of the idea of a foundation taking actions to "appropriate" fundamental mathematical questions and "attach its name to them".[7]

Solved problem
Poincar√© conjecture
Main article: Poincar√© conjecture
In the field of geometric topology, a two-dimensional sphere is characterized by the fact that it is the only closed and simply-connected two-dimensional surface. In 1904, Henri Poincar√© posed the question of whether an analogous statement holds true for three-dimensional shapes. This came to be known as the Poincar√© conjecture, the precise formulation of which states:
Any three-dimensional topological manifold which is closed and simply-connected must be homeomorphic to the 3-sphere.

Although the conjecture is usually stated in this form, it is equivalent (as was discovered in the 1950s) to pose it in the context of smooth manifolds and diffeomorphisms.

A proof of this conjecture, together with the more powerful geometrization conjecture, was given by Grigori Perelman in 2002 and 2003. Perelman's solution completed Richard Hamilton's program for the solution of the geometrization conjecture, which he had developed over the course of the preceding twenty years. Hamilton and Perelman's work revolved around Hamilton's Ricci flow, which is a complicated system of partial differential equations defined in the field of Riemannian geometry.

For his contributions to the theory of Ricci flow, Perelman was awarded the Fields Medal in 2006. However, he declined to accept the prize.[8] For his proof of the Poincar√© conjecture, Perelman was awarded the Millennium Prize on March 18, 2010.[9] However, he declined the award and the associated prize money, stating that Hamilton's contribution was no less than his own.[10]

Unsolved problems
Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture
Main article: Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture
The Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture deals with certain types of equations: those defining elliptic curves over the rational numbers. The conjecture is that there is a simple way to tell whether such equations have a finite or infinite number of rational solutions. Hilbert's tenth problem dealt with a more general type of equation, and in that case it was proven that there is no way to decide whether a given equation even has any solutions.

The official statement of the problem was given by Andrew Wiles.[11]

Hodge conjecture
Main article: Hodge conjecture
The Hodge conjecture is that for projective algebraic varieties, Hodge cycles are rational linear combinations of algebraic cycles.

{\displaystyle \operatorname {Hdg} ^{k}(X)=H^{2k}(X,\mathbb {Q} )\cap H^{k,k}(X).}
We call this the group of Hodge classes of degree 2k on X.

The modern statement of the Hodge conjecture is:

Let X be a non-singular complex projective variety. Then every Hodge class on X is a linear combination with rational coefficients of the cohomology classes of complex subvarieties of X.
The official statement of the problem was given by Pierre Deligne.[12]

The Navier‚ÄìStokes equations describe the motion of fluids, and are one of the pillars of fluid mechanics. However, theoretical understanding of their solutions is incomplete, despite its importance in science and engineering. For the three-dimensional system of equations, and given some initial conditions, mathematicians have not yet proven that smooth solutions always exist. This is called the Navier‚ÄìStokes existence and smoothness problem.

The problem, restricted to the case of an incompressible fluid, is to prove either that smooth, globally defined solutions exist that meet certain conditions, or that they do not always exist and the equations break down. The official statement of the problem was given by Charles Fefferman.[13]

P versus NP

Euler diagram for P, NP, NP-complete, and NP-hard set of problems (excluding the empty language and its complement, which belong to P but are not NP-complete)
Main article: P versus NP problem
The question is whether or not, for all problems for which an algorithm can verify a given solution quickly (that is, in polynomial time), an algorithm can also find that solution quickly. Since the former describes the class of problems termed NP, while the latter describes P, the question is equivalent to asking whether all problems in NP are also in P. This is generally considered one of the most important open questions in mathematics and theoretical computer science as it has far-reaching consequences to other problems in mathematics, to biology,[14] philosophy[15] and to cryptography (see P versus NP problem proof consequences). A common example of an NP problem not known to be in P is the Boolean satisfiability problem.

Most mathematicians and computer scientists expect that P ‚â† NP; however, it remains unproven.[16]

The official statement of the problem was given by Stephen Cook.[17]

Riemann hypothesis

The real part (red) and imaginary part (blue) of the Riemann zeta function along the critical line Re(s) = 1/2. The first nontrivial zeros can be seen at Im(s) = ¬±14.135, ¬±21.022 and ¬±25.011.

The Riemann zeta function Œ∂(s) is a function whose arguments may be any complex number other than 1, and whose values are also complex. Its analytical continuation has zeros at the negative even integers; that is, Œ∂(s) = 0 when s is one of ‚àí2, ‚àí4, ‚àí6, .... These are called its trivial zeros. However, the negative even integers are not the only values for which the zeta function is zero. The other ones are called nontrivial zeros. The Riemann hypothesis is concerned with the locations of these nontrivial zeros, and states that:

The real part of every nontrivial zero of the Riemann zeta function is 1/2.
The Riemann hypothesis is that all nontrivial zeros of the analytical continuation of the Riemann zeta function have a real part of ¬Ω. A proof or disproof of this would have far-reaching implications in number theory, especially for the distribution of prime numbers. This was Hilbert's eighth problem, and is still considered an important open problem a century later.

The problem has been well-known ever since it was originally posed by Bernhard Riemann in 1860. The Clay Institute's exposition of the problem was given by Enrico Bombieri.[18]

Yang‚ÄìMills existence and mass gap
Main article: Yang‚ÄìMills existence and mass gap
In quantum field theory, the mass gap is the difference in energy between the vacuum and the next lowest energy state. The energy of the vacuum is zero by definition, and assuming that all energy states can be thought of as particles in plane-waves, the mass gap is the mass of the lightest particle.

For a given real field

{\displaystyle \Delta _{0}>0} being the lowest energy value in the spectrum of the Hamiltonian and thus the mass gap. This quantity, easy to generalize to other fields, is what is generally measured in lattice computations.

Quantum Yang‚ÄìMills theory is the current grounding for the majority of theoretical applications of thought to the reality and potential realities of elementary particle physics.[19] The theory is a generalization of the Maxwell theory of electromagnetism where the chromo-electromagnetic field itself carries charge. As a classical field theory it has solutions which travel at the speed of light so that its quantum version should describe massless particles (gluons). However, the postulated phenomenon of color confinement permits only bound states of gluons, forming massive particles. This is the mass gap. Another aspect of confinement is asymptotic freedom which makes it conceivable that quantum Yang-Mills theory exists without restriction to low energy scales. The problem is to establish rigorously the existence of the quantum Yang‚ÄìMills theory and a mass gap.

Prove that for any compact simple gauge group G, a non-trivial quantum Yang‚ÄìMills theory exists on 
ùëÖ

{\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{4}} and has a mass gap Œî > 0. Existence includes establishing axiomatic properties at least as strong as those cited in Streater & Wightman (1964),[20] Osterwalder & Schrader (1973),[21] and Osterwalder & Schrader (1975).[22]
The official statement of the problem was given by Arthur Jaffe and Edward Witten.[23]

There are many longstanding unsolved problems in mathematics for which a solution has still not yet been found. The notable unsolved problems in statistics are generally of a different flavor; according to John Tukey,[1] "difficulties in identifying problems have delayed statistics far more than difficulties in solving problems." A list of "one or two open problems" (in fact 22 of them) was given by David Cox.[2]

Inference and testing
How to detect and correct for systematic errors, especially in sciences where random errors are large (a situation Tukey termed uncomfortable science).
The Graybill‚ÄìDeal estimator is often used to estimate the common mean of two normal populations with unknown and possibly unequal variances. Though this estimator is generally unbiased, its admissibility remains to be shown.[3]
Meta-analysis: Though independent p-values can be combined using Fisher's method, techniques are still being developed to handle the case of dependent p-values.
Behrens‚ÄìFisher problem: Yuri Linnik showed in 1966 that there is no uniformly most powerful test for the difference of two means when the variances are unknown and possibly unequal. That is, there is no exact test (meaning that, if the means are in fact equal, one that rejects the null hypothesis with probability exactly Œ±) that is also the most powerful for all values of the variances (which are thus nuisance parameters). Though there are many approximate solutions (such as Welch's t-test), the problem continues to attract attention[4] as one of the classic problems in statistics.
Multiple comparisons: There are various ways to adjust p-values to compensate for the simultaneous or sequential testing of hypotheses. Of particular interest is how to simultaneously control the overall error rate, preserve statistical power, and incorporate the dependence between tests into the adjustment. These issues are especially relevant when the number of simultaneous tests can be very large, as is increasingly the case in the analysis of data from DNA microarrays.[citation needed]
Bayesian statistics: A list of open problems in Bayesian statistics has been proposed.[5]
Experimental design
As the theory of Latin squares is a cornerstone in the design of experiments, solving the problems in Latin squares could have immediate applicability to experimental design.[citation needed]
Problems of a more philosophical nature
Sampling of species problem: How is a probability updated when there is unanticipated new data?[6]
Doomsday argument: How valid is the probabilistic argument that claims to predict the future lifetime of the human race given only an estimate of the total number of humans born so far?

The following is a list of notable unsolved problems grouped into broad areas of physics.[1]

Some of the major unsolved problems in physics are theoretical, meaning that existing theories seem incapable of explaining a certain observed phenomenon or experimental result. The others are experimental, meaning that there is a difficulty in creating an experiment to test a proposed theory or investigate a phenomenon in greater detail.

There are still some questions beyond the Standard Model of physics, such as the strong CP problem, neutrino mass, matter‚Äìantimatter asymmetry, and the nature of dark matter and dark energy.[2][3] Another problem lies within the mathematical framework of the Standard Model itself‚Äîthe Standard Model is inconsistent with that of general relativity, to the point that one or both theories break down under certain conditions (for example within known spacetime singularities like the Big Bang and the centres of black holes beyond the event horizon).[4]

General physics
Theory of everything: Is there a singular, all-encompassing, coherent theoretical framework of physics that fully explains and links together all physical aspects of the universe?
Dimensionless physical constants: At the present time, the values of various dimensionless physical constants cannot be calculated; they can be determined only by physical measurement.[5][6] What is the minimum number of dimensionless physical constants from which all other dimensionless physical constants can be derived? Are dimensional physical constants necessary at all?
Quantum gravity
Quantum gravity: Can quantum mechanics and general relativity be realized as a fully consistent theory (perhaps as a quantum field theory)?[7] Is spacetime fundamentally continuous or discrete? Would a consistent theory involve a force mediated by a hypothetical graviton, or be a product of a discrete structure of spacetime itself (as in loop quantum gravity)? Are there deviations from the predictions of general relativity at very small or very large scales or in other extreme circumstances that flow from a quantum gravity mechanism?
Black holes, black hole information paradox, and black hole radiation: Do black holes produce thermal radiation, as expected on theoretical grounds?[8] Does this radiation contain information about their inner structure, as suggested by gauge‚Äìgravity duality, or not, as implied by Hawking's original calculation? If not, and black holes can evaporate away, what happens to the information stored in them (since quantum mechanics does not provide for the destruction of information)? Or does the radiation stop at some point, leaving black hole remnants? Is there another way to probe their internal structure somehow, if such a structure even exists?
The cosmic censorship hypothesis and the chronology protection conjecture: Can singularities not hidden behind an event horizon, known as "naked singularities", arise from realistic initial conditions, or is it possible to prove some version of the "cosmic censorship hypothesis" of Roger Penrose which proposes that this is impossible?[9] Similarly, will the closed timelike curves which arise in some solutions to the equations of general relativity (and which imply the possibility of backwards time travel) be ruled out by a theory of quantum gravity which unites general relativity with quantum mechanics, as suggested by the "chronology protection conjecture" of Stephen Hawking?
Holographic principle: Is it true that quantum gravity admits a lower-dimensional description that does not contain gravity? A well-understood example of holography is the AdS/CFT correspondence in string theory. Similarly, can quantum gravity in a de Sitter space be understood using dS/CFT correspondence? Can the AdS/CFT correspondence be vastly generalized to the gauge‚Äìgravity duality for arbitrary asymptotic spacetime backgrounds? Are there other theories of quantum gravity other than string theory that admit a holographic description?
Quantum spacetime or the emergence of spacetime: Is the nature of spacetime at the Planck scale very different from the continuous classical dynamical spacetime that exists in General relativity? In loop quantum gravity, the spacetime is postulated to be discrete from the beginning. In string theory, although originally spacetime was considered just like in General relativity (with the only difference being supersymmetry), recent research building upon the Ryu‚ÄìTakayanagi conjecture has taught that spacetime in string theory is emergent by using quantum information theoretic concepts such as entanglement entropy in the AdS/CFT correspondence.[10] However, how exactly the familiar classical spacetime emerges within string theory or the AdS/CFT correspondence is still not well understood.
Problem of time: In quantum mechanics, time is a classical background parameter, and the flow of time is universal and absolute. In general relativity, time is one component of four-dimensional spacetime, and the flow of time changes depending on the curvature of spacetime and the spacetime trajectory of the observer. How can these two concepts of time be reconciled?[11]
Quantum physics
Yang‚ÄìMills theory: Given an arbitrary compact gauge group, does a non-trivial quantum Yang‚ÄìMills theory with a finite mass gap exist? (This problem is also listed as one of the Millennium Prize Problems in mathematics.)[12]
Quantum field theory (this is a generalization of the previous problem): Is it possible to construct, in a mathematically rigorous way, a quantum field theory in 4-dimensional spacetime that includes interactions and does not resort to perturbative methods?
Cosmology and general relativity
Axis of evil: Some large features of the microwave sky at distances of over 13 billion light years appear to be aligned with both the motion and orientation of the solar system. Is this due to systematic errors in processing, contamination of results by local effects, an unexplained violation of the Copernican principle and thus the concordance model, or are these features simply statistically insignificant?
Fine-tuned universe: The values of the fundamental physical constants are in a narrow range necessary to support carbon-based life.[13][14][15] Is this because there are an infinite number of other universes with different constants, or are our universe's constants the result of chance, intelligent design (by a personal being such as the theist's "God"), or some other factor or process? (See also the anthropic principle.)
Cosmic inflation: Is the theory of cosmic inflation in the very early universe correct, and, if so, what are the details of this epoch? What is the hypothetical inflaton scalar field that gave rise to this cosmic inflation? If inflation happened at one point, is it self-sustaining through inflation of quantum-mechanical fluctuations, and thus ongoing in some extremely distant place?[16]
Horizon problem: Why is the distant universe so homogeneous when the Big Bang theory seems to predict larger measurable anisotropies of the night sky than those observed? Cosmological inflation is generally accepted as the solution, but are other possible explanations such as a variable speed of light more appropriate?[17]
Origin and future of the universe: How did the conditions for anything to exist arise? Is the universe heading towards a Big Freeze, a Big Rip, a Big Crunch, or a Big Bounce?
Size of universe: The diameter of the observable universe is about 93 billion light-years, but what is the size of the whole universe? Is the universe infinite?
Baryon asymmetry: Why is there far more matter than antimatter in the observable universe? (This may be solved due to the apparent asymmetry in neutrino-antineutrino oscillations.)[18]
Cosmological principle: Is the universe homogeneous and isotropic at large enough scales, as claimed by the cosmological principle and assumed by all models that use the Friedmann‚ÄìLema√Ætre‚ÄìRobertson‚ÄìWalker metric, including the current version of the ŒõCDM model, or is the universe inhomogeneous or anisotropic?[19] Is the CMB dipole purely kinematic, or does it signal anisotropy of the universe, resulting in the breakdown of the FLRW metric and the cosmological principle?[19] Is the Hubble tension evidence that the cosmological principle is false?[19] Even if the cosmological principle is correct, is the Friedmann‚ÄìLema√Ætre‚ÄìRobertson‚ÄìWalker metric the right metric to use for our universe?[20][19] Are the observations usually interpreted as the accelerating expansion of the universe rightly interpreted, or are they instead evidence that the cosmological principle is false?[21][22]
Copernican principle: Are cosmological observations made from Earth representative of observations from the average position in the universe?
Cosmological constant problem: Why does the zero-point energy of the vacuum not cause a large cosmological constant? What cancels it out?[23][24][a]

Estimated distribution of dark matter and dark energy in the universe
Dark matter: What is the identity of dark matter?[17] Is it a particle? If so, is it a WIMP, axion, the lightest superpartner (LSP), or some other particle? Or, do the phenomena attributed to dark matter point not to some form of matter but actually to an extension of gravity?
Dark energy: What is the cause of the observed accelerating expansion of the universe (the de Sitter phase)? Are the observations rightly interpreted as the accelerating expansion of the universe, or are they evidence that the cosmological principle is false?[21][22] Why is the energy density of the dark energy component of the same magnitude as the density of matter at present when the two evolve quite differently over time; could it be simply that we are observing at exactly the right time? Is dark energy a pure cosmological constant or are models of quintessence such as phantom energy applicable?
Dark flow: Is a non-spherically symmetric gravitational pull from outside the observable universe responsible for some of the observed motion of large objects such as galactic clusters in the universe?
Shape of the universe: What is the 3-manifold of comoving space, i.e., of a comoving spatial section of the universe, informally called the "shape" of the universe? Neither the curvature nor the topology is presently known, though the curvature is known to be "close" to zero on observable scales. The cosmic inflation hypothesis suggests that the shape of the universe may be unmeasurable, but, since 2003, Jean-Pierre Luminet, et al., and other groups have suggested that the shape of the universe may be the Poincar√© dodecahedral space. Is the shape unmeasurable; the Poincar√© space; or another 3-manifold?
Extra dimensions: Does nature have more than four spacetime dimensions? If so, what is their size? Are dimensions a fundamental property of the universe or an emergent result of other physical laws? Can we experimentally observe evidence of higher spatial dimensions?
High-energy/particle physics
See also: Beyond the Standard Model
Hierarchy problem: Why is gravity such a weak force? It becomes strong for particles only at the Planck scale, around 1019 GeV, much above the electroweak scale (100 GeV, the energy scale dominating physics at low energies); why are these scales so different from each other? What prevents quantities at the electroweak scale, such as the Higgs boson mass, from getting quantum corrections on the order of the Planck scale? Is the solution supersymmetry, extra dimensions, or just anthropic fine-tuning?
Magnetic monopoles: Did particles that carry "magnetic charge" exist in some past, higher-energy epoch? If so, do any remain today? (Paul Dirac showed the existence of some types of magnetic monopoles would explain charge quantization.)[25]
Neutron lifetime puzzle: While the neutron lifetime has been studied for decades, there currently exists a lack of consilience on its exact value, due to different results from two experimental methods ("bottle" versus "beam").[26][b]
Proton decay and spin crisis: Is the proton fundamentally stable? Or does it decay with a finite lifetime as predicted by some extensions to the standard model?[27] How do the quarks and gluons carry the spin of protons?[28]
Grand Unification: Are the electromagnetic and nuclear forces different aspects of a Grand Unified Theory? If so, what symmetry governs this force and its behaviours?[29]
Supersymmetry: Is spacetime supersymmetry realized at TeV scale? If so, what is the mechanism of supersymmetry breaking? Does supersymmetry stabilize the electroweak scale, preventing high quantum corrections? Does the lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP) comprise dark matter?
Color confinement: The quantum chromodynamics (QCD) color confinement conjecture is that color-charged particles (such as quarks and gluons) cannot be separated from their parent hadron without producing new hadrons.[30] Is it possible to provide an analytic proof of color confinement in any non-abelian gauge theory?

Colour Confinement is the observed phenomenon that colored particles (quarks and gluons) cannot be isolated and are always bound to color neutral groups (at low energies). Such bound states are generally called hadrons.
The QCD vacuum: Many of the equations in non-perturbative QCD are currently unsolved. These energies are the energies sufficient for the formation and description of atomic nuclei. How thus does low energy /non-pertubative QCD give rise to the formation of complex nuclei and nuclear constituents?[citation needed]
Generations of matter: Why are there three generations of quarks and leptons? Is there a theory that can explain the masses of particular quarks and leptons in particular generations from first principles (a theory of Yukawa couplings)?[31]
Neutrino mass: What is the mass of neutrinos, whether they follow Dirac or Majorana statistics? Is the mass hierarchy normal or inverted? Is the CP violating phase equal to 0?[32][33]
Reactor antineutrino anomaly: There is an anomaly in the existing body of data regarding the antineutrino flux from nuclear reactors around the world. Measured values of this flux appears to be only 94% of the value expected from theory.[34] It is unknown whether this is due to unknown physics (such as sterile neutrinos), experimental error in the measurements, or errors in the theoretical flux calculations.[35]
Strong CP problem and axions: Why is the strong nuclear interaction invariant to parity and charge conjugation? Is Peccei‚ÄìQuinn theory the solution to this problem? Could axions be the main component of dark matter?
Anomalous magnetic dipole moment: Why is the experimentally measured value of the muon's anomalous magnetic dipole moment ("muon g ‚àí 2") significantly different from the theoretically predicted value of that physical constant?[36]
Proton radius puzzle: What is the electric charge radius of the proton? How does it differ from a gluonic charge?
Pentaquarks and other exotic hadrons: What combinations of quarks are possible? Why were pentaquarks so difficult to discover?[37] Are they a tightly bound system of five elementary particles, or a more weakly-bound pairing of a baryon and a meson?[38]
Mu problem: A problem in supersymmetric theories, concerned with understanding the reasons for parameter values of the theory.
Koide formula: An aspect of the problem of particle generations. The sum of the masses of the three charged leptons, divided by the square of the sum of the roots of these masses, to within one standard deviation of observations, is Q = 2‚ÅÑ3. It is unknown how such a simple value comes about, and why it is the exact arithmetic average of the possible extreme values of ‚Å†
‚ÄØ1‚ÄØ
/
3
‚Å† (equal masses) and 1 (one mass dominates).
Strange Matter: Does Strange Matter exist? Is it stable? Can they form Strange Stars? Is strange matter stable at 0 pressure (i.e in the vacuum)?
Glueballs: Do they exist in nature?
The gallium anomaly: The measurements of the charged-current capture rate of neutrinos on Ga from strong radioactive sources have yielded results below those expected, based on the known strength of the principal transition supplemented by theory.[39]
Astronomy and astrophysics
Main article: List of unsolved problems in astronomy
Solar cycle: How does the Sun generate its periodically reversing large-scale magnetic field? How do other solar-like stars generate their magnetic fields, and what are the similarities and differences between stellar activity cycles and that of the Sun?[40] What caused the Maunder Minimum and other grand minima, and how does the solar cycle recover from a minima state?
Coronal heating problem: Why is the Sun's corona (atmosphere layer) so much hotter than the Sun's surface? Why is the magnetic reconnection effect many orders of magnitude faster than predicted by standard models?
Astrophysical jet: Why do only certain accretion discs surrounding certain astronomical objects emit relativistic jets along their polar axes? Why are there quasi-periodic oscillations in many accretion discs?[41] Why does the period of these oscillations scale as the inverse of the mass of the central object?[42] Why are there sometimes overtones, and why do these appear at different frequency ratios in different objects?[43]
Diffuse interstellar bands: What is responsible for the numerous interstellar absorption lines detected in astronomical spectra? Are they molecular in origin, and if so which molecules are responsible for them? How do they form?[44][45]
Supermassive black holes: What is the origin of the M‚Äìsigma relation between supermassive black hole mass and galaxy velocity dispersion?[46] How did the most distant quasars grow their supermassive black holes up to 1010 solar masses so early in the history of the universe?
Kuiper cliff: Why does the number of objects in the Solar System's Kuiper belt fall off rapidly and unexpectedly beyond a radius of 50 astronomical units?
Flyby anomaly: Why is the observed energy of satellites flying by planetary bodies sometimes different by a minute amount from the value predicted by theory?

Ultra-high-energy cosmic ray:[17] Why is it that some cosmic rays appear to possess energies that are impossibly high, given that there are no sufficiently energetic cosmic ray sources near the Earth? Why is it that (apparently) some cosmic rays emitted by distant sources have energies above the Greisen‚ÄìZatsepin‚ÄìKuzmin limit?[47][17]
Rotation rate of Saturn: Why does the magnetosphere of Saturn exhibit a (slowly changing) periodicity close to that at which the planet's clouds rotate? What is the true rotation rate of Saturn's deep interior?[48]
Origin of magnetar magnetic field: What is the origin of magnetar magnetic field?
Large-scale anisotropy: Is the universe at very large scales anisotropic, making the cosmological principle an invalid assumption? The number count and intensity dipole anisotropy in radio, NRAO VLA Sky Survey (NVSS) catalogue[49] is inconsistent with the local motion as derived from cosmic microwave background[50][51] and indicate an intrinsic dipole anisotropy. The same NVSS radio data also shows an intrinsic dipole in polarization density and degree of polarization[52] in the same direction as in number count and intensity. There are several other observations revealing large-scale anisotropy. The optical polarization from quasars shows polarization alignment over a very large scale of Gpc.[53][54][55] The cosmic-microwave-background data shows several features of anisotropy,[56][57][58][59] which are not consistent with the Big Bang model.
Age‚Äìmetallicity relation in the Galactic disk: Is there a universal age‚Äìmetallicity relation (AMR) in the Galactic disk (both "thin" and "thick" parts of the disk)? Although in the local (primarily thin) disk of the Milky Way there is no evidence of a strong AMR,[60] a sample of 229 nearby "thick" disk stars has been used to investigate the existence of an age‚Äìmetallicity relation in the Galactic thick disk, and indicate that there is an age‚Äìmetallicity relation present in the thick disk.[61][62] Stellar ages from asteroseismology confirm the lack of any strong age‚Äìmetallicity relation in the Galactic disc.[63]
The lithium problem: Why is there a discrepancy between the amount of lithium-7 predicted to be produced in Big Bang nucleosynthesis and the amount observed in very old stars?[64]
Ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs): What powers X-ray sources that are not associated with active galactic nuclei but exceed the Eddington limit of a neutron star or stellar black hole? Are they due to intermediate-mass black holes? Some ULXs are periodic, suggesting non-isotropic emission from a neutron star. Does this apply to all ULXs? How could such a system form and remain stable?
Fast radio bursts (FRBs): What causes these transient radio pulses from distant galaxies, lasting only a few milliseconds each? Why do some FRBs repeat at unpredictable intervals, but most do not? Dozens of models have been proposed, but none have been widely accepted.[65]
Nuclear physics

Quantum chromodynamics: What are the phases of strongly interacting matter, and what roles do they play in the evolution of the cosmos? What is the detailed partonic structure of the nucleons? What does QCD predict for the properties of strongly interacting matter? What determines the key features of QCD, and what is their relation to the nature of gravity and spacetime? Does QCD truly lack CP violations?
Quark‚Äìgluon plasma: Where is the onset of deconfinement: 1) as a function of temperature and chemical potentials? 2) as a function of relativistic heavy-ion collision energy and system size? What is the mechanism of energy and baryon-number stopping leading to creation of quark-gluon plasma in relativistic heavy-ion collisions? Why is sudden hadronization and the statistical-hadronization model a near-to-perfect description of hadron production from quark‚Äìgluon plasma? Is quark flavor conserved in quark‚Äìgluon plasma? Are strangeness and charm in chemical equilibrium in quark‚Äìgluon plasma? Does strangeness in quark‚Äìgluon plasma flow at the same speed as up and down quark flavours? Why does deconfined matter show ideal flow?

Turbulent flow: Is it possible to make a theoretical model to describe the statistics of a turbulent flow (in particular, its internal structures)?[47]
Granular convection: why does a granular material subjected to shaking or vibration exhibit circulation patterns similar to types of fluid convection? Why do the largest particles end up on the surface of a granular material containing a mixture of variously sized objects when subjected to a vibration/shaking?[67]
Condensed matter physics

A sample of a cuprate superconductor (specifically BSCCO). The mechanism for superconductivity of these materials is unknown.
Bose‚ÄìEinstein condensation: How do we rigorously prove the existence of Bose‚ÄìEinstein condensates for general interacting systems?[68]

Universality of low-temperature amorphous solids: why is the small dimensionless ratio of the phonon wavelength to its mean free path nearly the same for a very large family of disordered solids?[72][73] This small ratio is observed for very large range of phonon frequencies.
Cryogenic electron emission: Why does the electron emission in the absence of light increase as the temperature of a photomultiplier is decreased?[74][75]

Post-quantum cryptography: Can we prove that some cryptographic protocols are safe against quantum computers?[89]
Quantum capacity: The capacity of a quantum channel is in general not known.[92]
Plasma physics
Plasma physics and fusion power: Fusion energy may potentially provide power from an abundant resource (e.g. hydrogen) without the type of radioactive waste that fission energy currently produces. However, can ionized gases (plasma) be confined long enough and at a high enough temperature to create fusion power? What is the physical origin of H-mode?[93]
The injection problem: Fermi acceleration is thought to be the primary mechanism that accelerates astrophysical particles to high energy. However, it is unclear what mechanism causes those particles to initially have energies high enough for Fermi acceleration to work on them.[94]

Biophysics
Stochasticity and robustness to noise in gene expression: How do genes govern our body, withstanding different external pressures and internal stochasticity? Certain models exist for genetic processes, but we are far from understanding the whole picture, in particular in development where gene expression must be tightly regulated.
Quantitative study of the immune system: What are the quantitative properties of immune responses? What are the basic building blocks of immune system networks?

Protein structure prediction: How is the three-dimensional structure of proteins determined by the one-dimensional amino acid sequence? How can proteins fold on microsecond to second timescales when the number of possible conformations is astronomical and conformational transitions occur on the picosecond to microsecond timescale? Can algorithms be written to predict a protein's three-dimensional structure from its sequence? Do the native structures of most naturally occurring proteins coincide with the global minimum of the free energy in conformational space? Or are most native conformations thermodynamically unstable, but kinetically trapped in metastable states? What keeps the high density of proteins present inside cells from precipitating?[96]
Quantum biology: Can coherence be maintained in biological systems at timeframes long enough to be functionally important? Are there non-trivial aspects of biology or biochemistry that can only be explained by the persistence of coherence as a mechanism?
Foundations of physics
Interpretation of quantum mechanics: How does the quantum description of reality, which includes elements such as the superposition of states and wavefunction collapse or quantum decoherence, give rise to the reality we perceive?[47] Another way of stating this question regards the measurement problem: What constitutes a "measurement" which apparently causes the wave function to collapse into a definite state? Unlike classical physical processes, some quantum mechanical processes (such as quantum teleportation arising from quantum entanglement) cannot be simultaneously "local", "causal", and "real", but it is not obvious which of these properties must be sacrificed,[97] or if an attempt to describe quantum mechanical processes in these senses is a category error such that a proper understanding of quantum mechanics would render the question meaningless. Can the many worlds interpretation resolve it?
Arrow of time (e.g. entropy's arrow of time): Why does time have a direction? Why did the universe have such low entropy in the past, and time correlates with the universal (but not local) increase in entropy, from the past and to the future, according to the second law of thermodynamics?[47] Why are CP violations observed in certain weak force decays, but not elsewhere? Are CP violations somehow a product of the second law of thermodynamics, or are they a separate arrow of time? Are there exceptions to the principle of causality? Is there a single possible past? Is the present moment physically distinct from the past and future, or is it merely an emergent property of consciousness? What links the quantum arrow of time to the thermodynamic arrow?
Locality: Are there non-local phenomena in quantum physics?[98][99] If they exist, are non-local phenomena limited to the entanglement revealed in the violations of the Bell inequalities, or can information and conserved quantities also move in a non-local way? Under what circumstances are non-local phenomena observed? What does the existence or absence of non-local phenomena imply about the fundamental structure of spacetime? How does this elucidate the proper interpretation of the fundamental nature of quantum physics?
Problems solved since the 1990s
General physics/quantum physics
Perform a loophole-free Bell test experiment (1970[100]‚Äì2015): In October 2015, scientists from the Kavli Institute of Nanoscience reported that the failure of the local hidden-variable hypothesis is supported at the 96% confidence level based on a "loophole-free Bell test" study.[101][102] These results were confirmed by two studies with statistical significance over 5 standard deviations which were published in December 2015.[103][104]
Create Bose‚ÄìEinstein condensate (1924[105]‚Äì1995): Composite bosons in the form of dilute atomic vapours were cooled to quantum degeneracy using the techniques of laser cooling and evaporative cooling.[citation needed]
Cosmology and general relativity
Existence of gravitational waves (1916‚Äì2016): On 11 February 2016, the Advanced LIGO team announced that they had directly detected gravitational waves from a pair of black holes merging,[106][107][108] which was also the first detection of a stellar binary black hole.
Numerical solution for binary black hole (1960s‚Äì2005): The numerical solution of the two body problem in general relativity was achieved after four decades of research. Three groups devised the breakthrough techniques in 2005 (annus mirabilis of numerical relativity).[109]
Cosmic age problem (1920s‚Äì1990s): The estimated age of the universe was around 3 to 8 billion years younger than estimates of the ages of the oldest stars in the Milky Way. Better estimates for the distances to the stars, and the recognition of the accelerating expansion of the universe, reconciled the age estimates.[citation needed]
High-energy physics/particle physics
Existence of pentaquarks (1964‚Äì2015): In July 2015, the LHCb collaboration at CERN identified pentaquarks in the Œõ0
b‚ÜíJ/œàK‚àíp channel, which represents the decay of the bottom lambda baryon (Œõ0
b) into a J/œà meson (J/œà), a kaon (K‚àí
) and a proton (p). The results showed that sometimes, instead of decaying directly into mesons and baryons, the Œõ0
b decayed via intermediate pentaquark states. The two states, named P+
c(4380) and P+
c(4450), had individual statistical significances of 9 œÉ and 12 œÉ, respectively, and a combined significance of 15 œÉ‚Äîenough to claim a formal discovery. The two pentaquark states were both observed decaying strongly to J/œàp, hence must have a valence quark content of two up quarks, a down quark, a charm quark, and an anti-charm quark (

), making them charmonium-pentaquarks.[110]
Existence of quark-gluon plasma, a new phase of matter was discovered and confirmed in experiments at CERN-SPS (2000), BNL-RHIC (2005) and CERN-LHC (2010).[111]
Higgs boson and electroweak symmetry breaking (1963[112]‚Äì2012): The mechanism responsible for breaking the electroweak gauge symmetry, giving mass to the W and Z bosons, was solved with the discovery of the Higgs boson of the Standard Model, with the expected couplings to the weak bosons. No evidence of a strong dynamics solution, as proposed by technicolor, has been observed.
Origin of mass of most elementary particles: Solved with the discovery of the Higgs boson, which implies the existence of the Higgs field giving mass to these particles.
Astronomy and astrophysics
Origin of short gamma-ray burst (1993[113]‚Äì2017): From binary neutron stars merger, produce a kilonova explosion and short gamma-ray burst GRB 170817A was detected in both electromagnetic waves and gravitational wave GW170817.[114][115]
Missing baryon problem (1998[116]‚Äì2017): proclaimed solved in October 2017, with the missing baryons located in hot intergalactic gas.[117][118]
Long-duration gamma-ray bursts (1993[113]‚Äì2003): Long-duration bursts are associated with the deaths of massive stars in a specific kind of supernova-like event commonly referred to as a collapsar. However, there are also long-duration GRBs that show evidence against an associated supernova, such as the Swift event GRB 060614.
Solar neutrino problem (1968[119]‚Äì2001): Solved by a new understanding of neutrino physics, requiring a modification of the Standard Model of particle physics‚Äîspecifically, neutrino oscillation.
Saturn's core spin was determined from its gravitational field.[120]
Nuclear physics
Hagedorn temperature recognized as phase transformation temperature between hadronic confined phase and deconfined phase of matter.
Rapidly solved problems
Existence of time crystals (2012‚Äì2016): The idea of a quantized time crystal was first theorized in 2012 by Frank Wilczek.[121][122] In 2016, Khemani et al.[123] and Else et al.[124] independently of each other suggested that periodically driven quantum spin systems could show similar behaviour. Also in 2016, Norman Yao at UC Berkeley and colleagues proposed a different way to create discrete time crystals in spin systems.[125] This was then used by two teams, a group led by Christopher Monroe at the University of Maryland and a group led by Mikhail Lukin at Harvard University, who were both able to show evidence for time crystals in the laboratory setting, showing that for short times the systems exhibited the dynamics similar to the predicted one.[126][127]
Photon underproduction crisis (2014‚Äì2015): This problem was resolved by Khaire and Srianand.[128] They show that a factor 2 to 5 times large metagalactic photoionization rate can be easily obtained using updated quasar and galaxy observations. Recent observations of quasars indicate that the quasar contribution to ultraviolet photons is a factor of 2 larger than previous estimates. The revised galaxy contribution is a factor of 3 larger. These together solve the crisis.
Hipparcos anomaly (1997[129]‚Äì2012): The High Precision Parallax Collecting Satellite (Hipparcos) measured the parallax of the Pleiades and determined a distance of 385 light years. This was significantly different from other measurements made by means of actual to apparent brightness measurement or absolute magnitude. The anomaly was due to the use of a weighted mean when there is a correlation between distances and distance errors for stars in clusters. It is resolved by using an unweighted mean. There is no systematic bias in the Hipparcos data when it comes to star clusters.[130]
Faster-than-light neutrino anomaly (2011‚Äì2012): In 2011, the OPERA experiment mistakenly observed neutrinos appearing to travel faster than light. On 12 July 2012 OPERA updated their paper after discovering an error in their previous flight time measurement. They found agreement of neutrino speed with the speed of light.[131]
Pioneer anomaly (1980‚Äì2012): There was a deviation in the predicted accelerations of the Pioneer 10 and 11 spacecraft as they left the Solar System.[47][17] It is believed that this is a result of previously unaccounted-for thermal recoil force.[132][133]

 "This problem is widely regarded as one of the major obstacles to further progress in fundamental physics ... Its importance has been emphasized by various authors from different aspects. For example, it has been described as a 'veritable crisis" ...] and even 'the mother of all physics problems' ... While it might be possible that people working on a particular problem tend to emphasize or even exaggerate its importance, those authors all agree that this is a problem that needs to be solved, although there is little agreement on what is the right direction to find the solution."[24]
 When physicists strip neutrons from atomic nuclei, put them in a bottle, then count how many remain there after some time, they infer that neutrons radioactively decay in 14 minutes and 39 seconds, on average. But when other physicists generate beams of neutrons and tally the emerging protons ‚Äî the particles that free neutrons decay into ‚Äî they peg the average neutron lifetime at around 14 minutes and 48 seconds. The discrepancy between the ‚Äúbottle‚Äù and ‚Äúbeam‚Äù measurements has persisted since both methods of gauging the neutron's longevity began yielding results in the 1990s. At first, all the measurements were so imprecise that nobody worried. Gradually, though, both methods have improved, and still they disagree.[26]

OK so uh there exist many lists:

https://faculty.washington.edu/steinerb/openproblems.pdf

From Quora Jeff Erickson:

There are thousands, if not millions, of open problems in computer science. Here are a dozen or so off the top of my head.

Does nondeterminism actually speed up computation? (Does P=NP?)

Can problems solvable with little space be solved quickly? (Does P = PSPACE?)

Does randomness actually speed up computation? (Does RP=P? BPP=P?)

How much does exploiting quantum computing actually speed up computing? (We know that it has some effect, because of Grover‚Äôs algorithm, but how much? Does BQP=P?)

Does nonuniformity actually speed up computation?

Can 3SAT be solved in 2o(n)time? (The Exponential Time Hypothesis)

Can kSAT be solved in O(20.9999n) time for all k? (The Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis)

Can 3SUM be solved in O(n1.99999) time?

Can Sorting X+Y be solved in O(n2) time? In O(n1.99999) time?

Can all-pairs shortest paths be solved in O(n2.99999)time?

Is the Unique Games Conjecture true?

Are monotone graph properties evasive?

Can maximum flows in planar graphs be computed in O(n) time?

Can maximum flows in (undirected, unit-capacity) toroidal graphs be computed in O(n1.49999) time? O(nlogn) time? O(n) time?

Is there an implementable algorithm to triangulate polygons in O(n) time?

Is there an implementable algorithm to decide whether a graph can be drawn on a torus without edge crossings in O(n) time?

What is the complete set of minimal forbidden minors for toroidal graphs? For graphs of genus 2? For graphs of treewidth 4?

Can an arbitrary context-free grammar of length $n$ be converted into Chomsky normal form in O(n1.9999) time? O(n3/2) time?

Are splay trees dynamically optimal? Is any online self-adjusting binary search tree dynamically optimal? Is any offline self-adjusting binary search tree dynamically optimal?

Can the genus of a knot be computed in polynomial time?

What is the fifth Ramsey number R(5,5)? The sixth Ramsey number R(6,6)? The seventh R(7,7)?

Is there a machine-checkable proof of Robertson and Seymour‚Äôs graph structure theorem? What about the classification theorem for finite simple groups?

What is the smallest Turing machine whose behavior is independent of ZFC?

Is any natural generalization of Getting Over It NP-hard? PSPACE-hard? Undecidable?

How many licks does it take to get to the Tootsie Roll center of a Tootsie Pop?

And this is just theoretical computer science.

How many points in general position are needed in R2 to force/induce a convex n-gon? Equivalently, compute the size of the maximal point set avoiding such an induced n-gon.

	Erdos-Mollin-Walsh Conjecture

There are no three consecutive powerful numbers, those with all exponents >=2 in prime factorisation.

	Erdos tasks.

	Minimum Area Triangles

Given a set of n points in the plane, we can find the minimum area triangle in quadratic time, but the best known lower bound is only Omega(n log n). Find a subquadratic algorithm, or prove a quadratic lower bound in any model of computation.

	Anchored Rectangles

Suppose we want to pack a unit square with non-overlapping rectangles that have sides parallel to the axes. The catch is that the lower left corners of all the rectangles are given. By the way, such rectangles are called anchored. Now, given some points in the unit square, aka the lower left corners, we want to find anchored rectangles with the maximum total area.

Increasing Permutation
When the given points are close to the right upper corner of the square, the total area is small. When a single point is in the bottom left corner of the square, we can cover the whole square. The problem becomes more interesting if we add one extra assumption: one of the given points has to be the bottom left corner of the square. In the 1960‚Äôs, it was conjectured by Allen Freedman that any set of points has an anchored rectangle packing with the area of at least one half. The problem is quite resistant. In 2011, Dumitrescu and T√≥th showed that every set of points has a packing of area at least 0.09, which was the first constant bound found, and is the best bound currently known.

	Enumerate Self Avoiding Walks

A self avoiding walk is a sequence of moves on a lattice not visiting the same point more than once. What is the number of self avoiding walks from [0,0] to [n-1,n-1] in an nxn grid, taking steps from [0,1], [0,-1], [1,0], [-1,0]?
