	Factorise The Input

So I need to think of the right hint for the target task but... one can generate say some very large values a where something like for example a+1, 2*a+7, 3*a+5, ... are all prime. Then multiply them to generate very very large semisemiprimes. OK well this comes in to actual runtimes. So say we set the task to have a runtime limit of 1000ms. Maybe we should do it where there are multiple test cases so we make the hardest set very hard to pass. And to pass that one they need to realise there is something sus' going on but also be even faster than say they can not even binary search for the answer but also need to be even faster by e.g. at least starting off their best guess for the solution here if the actual value was 400 or 500 bits or something to pass they even would need to start out with the right bound on the binary search being like well in this case (Input/6)^(1/3) but even that part would need to be computed quite rapidly to have a substantive edge over 0 on the left bound with a better guess or modulo forcing otherwise. Force very fast multiplication? Also need to think very hard about a hint which could lead to a solution this is a troll question but a hint which makes it soluble but does not obviously give it away I mean that it should occur to the contestants that it so happens we generated the input using a product of nomials with small magnitude coefficients.

	Meta 2024 Round 2 C

It would seem as though the Meta firm Hacker Cup division ought to have made stronger test cases. Perhaps forced parallel as well as a strategy splitting on the number of burrows. So for a small number one can directly loop through in O[count choose 2] and the way memory handling on the vector of vector of pairs works it should be pretty fast. Then for medium counts one can go in and do the 2-dimensional BIT Binary Indexed Tree approach. And also force it so that to pass the test cases somehow also mention something about large count cases in the mixture where contestants are forced in to using the O[R*C] approach. So I think that might be the optimal kind of code for this task. I have since updated my Meta 2024 Round 2 C 3.cpp file with further commentary. And yet the code could still be sharpened further to be sure. I reread Meta Hacker Cup's proposed solution and went ahead and implemented the line sweep approach with a 1-dimensional BIT Binary Indexed Tree. And intend to upsolve Task D as well as all future tasks.

	Common n-Grams

One would think my original solution is quite bad. There I essentially looped through with a vector of strings repeatedly adding up strings and then ++ing their multiplicities in a map [could be unordered] from strings to multiplicities. One improvement would be to use a deque there maybe. But another improvement could be to use hashing here and hash each word. Then processing through a vector of long long hashes to produce the n-gram hash is faster. The trick is to also make a map from hash to n-gram the first time we see a hash appear so we have also a map from hashes to multiplicities and later processing through that one we can recover the underlying n-gram string corresponding with a frequently-appearing hash. We also need precomputed powers of relevant prime moduli for computing the hashes of the merged strings relatively rapidly and also go in a sort of quasi deque fashion there for speedup on compute in C++. And in particular in the unordered map from hashes to strings we want the actual left and right end memory pointers rather than the whole substring for much faster processing and OK processing time later upon retrieval. This can also be accomplished by storing the locations of the " "s and hashing the entire sentence followed up by the usual string sentence substring subhashing O[1] call but this would depend on desired memory details as well as in streaming settings maybe with some assurance that the distribution is sort of OKish at which point we might be able to mix in some forgetting function with other details to only store the Top 1% most common recentish n-grams or whatever 2-grams and 3-grams in some unordered maps.

	IBM Ponder This 2023-10 Post Facto Analysis Inspired Task Draft

"
A la infinite enumeration proofs in mathematics demonstrating the cardinality of the rational numbers is the cardinality of the integers, one may more simply test pairs in an outwards spiral, thus ensuring to not introduce such an additional logarithmic or rather polylogarithmic factor. Other tasks might get improved performance from such styles of searches, depending on underlying memory performance issues in a row-by-row sequential C setting. Perhaps a relatively simple task could be composed where statistical properties lead to acceptance if and only if the competitor searches the subrectangle [x*9/20,x*11/20]x[y*9/20,y*11/20] row-by-row before searching other squares, potentially outwards in a spiral.

"The Show Goes On" is a song by American recording artist Lupe Fiasco, released by Atlantic Records on October 26, 2010, as the lead single from his third studio album Lasers.[1] The song was produced by Kane Beatz and features an uncredited guest appearance from JR Get Money, who performs the hook â€“ which is melodically interpolative of the 2004 song "Float On" by indie rock band Modest Mouse; as a result, band members Isaac Brock, Eric Judy and Benjamin Weikel are credited as co-writers, alongside Dustin Brower, as well as Lupe Fiasco, Kane Beatz and JR Get Money themselves.

"The Show Goes On" debuted at number 57 on the Billboard Hot 100, and peaked at number nine - it remains Fiasco's highest-charting song. It was released on iTunes on November 9, 2010, and in the UK on February 20, 2011. The song was a major point of contention for the artist and a reason for the lengthy delay of the album, making the title fitting; as Lupe was told unequivocally by record producers: "If you don't do 'The Show Goes On', your album's not coming out."[2] However, XXL named it 14th Best Song of 2011.[3] The song was nominated for Best Rap Performance and Best Rap Song at the 54th Grammy Awards.

Background
Lupe Fiasco announced the name of the single at the Fiasco Friday protest on October 15, 2010. On that day, Lyor Cohen came down to play the single for the protest turned celebrating fan base situated outside Atlantic Records. In a NovaFM interview, he gave an analysis of the first verse. He went on to say, "For them it was 'why is he talking about the record label, but it's still a great song. For me, I was like 'No, that's my therapy... To give you this song... Now you have to make it a worldwide smash. You have to play it on the radio... So every time you hear it, you're going to hear me talking about your ass."[4]

On February 28, 2011, what the Complex magazine published an interview with Lupe that detailed the background behind the single.[5]

There's nothing really to tell about that record, to be honest. I didn't have nothing to do with that record. That was the label's record. That wasn't like I knew the producer or knew the writer or anything like that. That was one of those records the record company gave me, [they even gave me] stuff they wanted me to rap about. It wasn't like, 'Hey I did this and I went to a mountain and found inspiration and it was this'. [...] I had to do "The Show Goes On", that was like the big chip on the table. I had to do it and it had to be the first single if the record was going to come out.

In an interview with The Adelaide Tribune, Lupe expanded further on his feelings toward the record.[6]

I was literally told for "The Show Goes On" that I shouldn't rap too deep. I shouldn't be too lyrical. It just needs to be something easy on the eyes. Like a record company telling Picasso that we don't need these abstract interpretations of life, where people have to sit down and look at it and break it down. It was better to paint the Upper West Side lady and her poodle so everyone could look at it right away and understand what was going on. I felt like I was painting poodles. It's why in the first line of "The Show Goes On" I paraphrase Johnny Rotten at the Sex Pistols' final show: "Have you ever had the feeling that you were being cheated".

Writing credits are given to Lupe Fiasco, Isaac Brock, Dustin Brower, Jonathon Brown, Dann Gallucci, Eric Judy and to producer Kane Beatz.[7]

The song was released on Lupe Fiasco's website on October 26 for download. This marked the first officially planned released single from Lasers ("Shining Down" and "I'm Beamin" were leaks re-released as street singles). "The Show Goes On" appeared on the iTunes Music Store on November 9.

Music video
The music video for "The Show Goes On" was released on December 25, 2010. It was directed by Hiro Murai and shows Lupe backstage preparing for a performance.[8] Contrary to popular belief [who?], the skull and crossbones glove is actually associated with Mastermind Japan the and not Lupe Fiasco's post-punk band, Japanese Cartoon. It was MTV's last Jam Of The Week of 2010. The video itself was nominated for MTV's Video Music Award for Best Hip Hop Video in 2011.

Chart performance
"The Show Goes On" peaked at No. 9 on the Billboard Hot 100, making this song Lupe's second top ten hit and biggest hit to date.[9] "The Show Goes On" is Lupe Fiasco's best-selling and highest-charting song to date. As of June 2011, the single has sold more than 3,000,000 digital units in the US.[10]

Nevertheless it is a very beautiful subpiece on one of the most beautiful pieces of music of all time thus far and is almost more beautiful given how coercive the situation was. Because 'Lu was mid-key coerced in to OBEYing and did and the executives still pumped out GOOD music with him.
