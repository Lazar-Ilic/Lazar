"
The only cure for materialism is the cleansing of the 6 senses [eyes, ears, nose, tongue, body, and brain]. If the senses are clogged, one's perception is stifled. The more it is stifled, the more contaminated the senses become. This creates disorder in the world, and that is the greatest evil of all. Polish the heart, free the 6 senses and let them function without obstruction, and your entire body and soul will glow.

	Setup

To maximise productivity, be 引きこもり, leave apartment 0, work 15 hours per day. Dynamic Range 感性 Facts. I am executing this .txt program. I use local files and Visual Studio Code|Google Chrome for nearly everything. My files organisation is reflected in my GitHub, I have unshared files locally.

	Calendar

Mine is a .txt file which works across devices. I can always see years ahead and remove pending items upon completion. Can include air filter replacement, rent, interviews, tests, groceries, upcoming Amazon purchases, etc. The first lines can contain daily reminders. Example:

"
How are you feeling, what are you curious about, how is research going? [To partner|wife|child. Record their responses in writing, plan accordingly, and follow up later.]

	Text Or LaTeX Everything

It is critical to record ideas, so that one can review them later. And the grading boost. The transition cost is low, and this habit yields massive upside. By "everything", I really mean everything! I suggest Googling ~ "GOV312 Exam 3 Quizlet" then [ctrl a] [ctrl c] [ctrl v] the 3 most recently published relevant Quizlets into a .txt file. Study this for 1 hour each day for 3 days leading in to the test with the completed review sheet also in a .txt file. This way, maybe obtain an A with a total of < 20 hours of labour. One can sometimes utilise the replace all function in Visual Studio Code and turn a .mobi or .pdf into a .txt file. I pick the best looking file from Library Genesis. Also, I have all my school work saved. Everything is backed up on a Google Drive. Have compute and memory. Save .txt articles and stuff.

Chronic Exposure To Notes
Dramatically improves learning and retention. When solving, many moving parts seem routine.

Brainstorming
Sometimes initial ideas are wrong and seemingly stupid ideas are right.

Drafting Weeks In Advance
Then one has following ideas.

Lists
For the Putnam, I created a list of topics I knew I needed to cover and understand deeply to maximise my expected performance.

Homework Writing
Include task details like "definition X" and "for matrix $A=\begin{bmatrix} 3 & 5 \\ 2 & 4 \end{bmatrix}$ one obtains eigenvectors..." so that later it makes sense as a self-contained document. Or include task statements. No "canonical", "Minimal", "immediate", "trivial", "of course", etc. Consider using a comment with "%" for WolframAlpha code. Save all school work and assignments.

Reading And Working Through Books
Take notes on definitions, key ideas, and related insights. Consider completionism: solving all tasks, or reading the first line of the solution and contemplating etc. This may be the 2nd best option to Graduate School. Email authors or post on Stack to ask questions.

Reading And Working Through Papers
Imagine insights, experiments, paths, and "how would I have thought of that?" type questions. See the bibliography. Email authors or post on Stack to ask questions.

Writing Papers
Record thoughts, tank, followup ideas, generalisations, can this be generalised? Read extant literature. Use keywords and massive list of citations for bibliography. Hack cross references. Line up many long editing sessions prior to submissions. Perhaps consult friends.

	Habits

Form them. Do homework upon release and go to class 0. I have a library of .pdf and .txt books and on day 0 of courses, copy all deadlines to calendar, perhaps take notes through the entire textbook, set up templates for all homework assignments including correct titling, and compile all readings and screenplays|film transcripts in to .txt files. One can often view past course syllabi when planning, have a .txt file of course numbers and details ready for registration opening time, and use a phone call Green button push or dual authentication code once per month on a machine by clicking to remember for 30 days.

	Lifestyle

Sleep, exercise, and diet are all important. What makes one person feel good may not make another person feel good. Breakfast and fruits|vegetables are not necessary. Many would benefit from the energy of eating chicken [rotisserie] fettuccine alfredo, ground grass fed beef, white rice, anything warm, NaCl table salty, maybe a tiny bit ~H2O Watery which will not cause too much bloating. Your mileage may vary with 12|12 hours intermittent fasting. Ensure to eat adequately by once in a while writing down on Calendar.txt to try modulating upwards. Muscle mass and Mg Magnesium relate with carbohydrate glycogen uptake and release. One can start off one's day with instant coffee. A 4|month indoor rowing half Marathon habit can potentially improve memory, cardiovascular strength, sense of wellbeing, baseline hedonic tone. Avoid indoor apartments, especially loud studios. Get a house on >= 2 acres. Consider air outside which will get on skin organ. Consider month-to-month or 1-6 month leases and strong early termination clauses during house and Trading job searches. For houses, one can get a free real estate agent, send desiderata, view > 30 houses whilst high and dehydrated early in the morning, and pick the one which will be best after 15 hours of optimisation upon moving in. Also consider houses on nice land which can turn in to a land purchase for an IO house on a later non-loaned demolition and construction. Closely monitour everything very crystal clearly technically and precisely, sounds, smells, certain materials, run air conditioning and heater monitouring sounds and smells, measuring indoor air quality, thermostat sensor location, examine patios, neighbours and neighbouring nearby firms, streets, read and measure 168 hours of exterior sound scores with one's own $100 Sony digital microphone instruments as well as interior at <=25dB for the entire duration of the 168 hours. >=70000 lumens|m^2 of sunlight measured through the IO skylights on to the IO work rooms' floors.

	Indoor Air Quality Maximisation | Background "Nerve Gas" Malodour Minimisation

Total Time: ~15 Hours

Odour particles emanate with various intensities and density curves|latencies of clearance. One ought to feel Minimal impulsion to touch nose, effectively clearing out boogies with ~H2O Water-rinsed fingers perhaps ×2|day. In a relatively low background malodour room environment the odours of orange juice, 14 days old bedding, and mildly uplifting ultrahighdefinition fidelity shaved untoweled poophole prior to toweling may be prominent or dominant. Plucking nose hairs is harmful, unhealthful, and not advisable. Malodour can transfer via chains like hand to doorknobs and later back to hands, so ensure to adequately rinse fingers skin. Some split air conditioners take unclean city air in flow and irreparable cracks and pressured air flows via neighbours' kitchens and air. Verify exterior 99% Al Aluminum Foil is blocking malodour particles flowing in by performing exterior malodour throughput testing, both subjective and machine verified. Air out wall paint from apartment while at office.

One can cover a home residential environment in ~Low-VolatileOrganicCompound 99% Al Aluminum Foil, cover walls, all wall-wall neighbour outlet suboptimal potential throughput joints, paints, doors, create quasi air seals everywhere including e.g. over toilet piping, hang at some door-floor joints monitouring thermics, weather strip interior closets, and put ~everything inside of sealed ~Low-VolatileOrganicCompound Bisphenol-A-Free Plastic boxes. Apply tape rigourously over cracks and at trim joints. Cover stinky floor from a very low height so as to not breathe in minor NaHCO3 baking soda particles with a thick layer of dry NaHCO3 Baking Soda. Do property damage, remove things, wipe insecticide and chemicals off of sills, ledges, door frames, trims, wrap interior laundry closet in 99% Al Aluminum Foil, etc.

	Teeth Brushing

Can do every morning, 30 minutes after meals, and following nightly Orange Juice. Rinse with ~H2O Water and thoroughly floss. 1 or 2 large dabs of the rather expensive but worthy Oranurse Unflavoured F- Fluoride Toothpaste. Thoroughly brush, do not push hard, at angles, until everything feels nice and smooth. Brush tongue and around mouth exterior with toothpaste. Rinse completely with ~H2O Water. Scrape tongue with teeth. Open mouth 0 during the day. Some people prefer avoiding F- Fluoride in their toothpaste and nose mouth throat brain organs. And some who enjoy to utilise Stabiliser-Free Food Grade ~3% H2O2 Hydrogen Peroxide diluted to ~1% qua mouthwash rinse rather than full on brushing in the morning fasted e.g.

Implementation

Setup
Extremely important. I run the Visual Studio Code text editor application [see 00 Settings.json] and compile and output in a Google Colab for C++ and Python or Kaggle for R on a 15.6in 1920x1080 Asus Google ChromeBook. Settings in Visual Studio Code are heavily modified rendering it a Minimal text editor with hover triggering information to appear [sometimes useful].

Books
Guide To Competitive Programming, Erickson, CLRS.

Chronic Exposure to Notes
I like reviewing my .txt files to refresh my memory and think about algorithms and implementations.

Resources
Competitive Programming Algorithms, Codeforces blogs, Codechef discussions, etc.

Problem Solving
Project Euler, Code Submission Evaluation System, AtCoder, Facebook Meta Hacker Cup, Google Code Jam. When preparing for X, do the contest X archive.

Reading Solutions
Pick tasks with editorials. Read after some time and implement. Read a lot of solutions files too to learn ideas. Look up unknown things and read further references.

Reading Code
Learn better ways of doing things.

Implementation
Do not be scared, practice, and this will be smooth. Use Notebook and modify it for ease of use. Filter by "accepted" and sort by execution time on AtCoder, Codeforces, etc. for performant C++ implementations.

Effective Debugging
Do not just ponder code logic: write print statements! Consider writing a naive implementation, comparing the outputs for variables.

Competing
Competing often makes it less stressful.

Hi,

I am interested in the construction of an Insulated Concrete Form house at [~2-10 acres isolated land address with perhaps Aquasana Filtered Optim~H2O Water and electricity, near Princeton, New Jersey]. I want it to be extremely Low-VolatileOrganicCompound in my judgement and quiet, including 14, 7 pairs of 12'x12'x10' rooms with separate air inflows and temperature controls. I want Low-VolatileOrganicCompound, this includes each and every component. I am uniquely seriously concerned on this specification, and care about it more than looks. A high quality 0 VolatileOrganicCompound monolithic drywall rather than a paper-backed or fibreglass-backed and 0 VolatileOrganicCompound flat White paint might work. All painted elements in 0 VolatileOrganicCompound [VOC] White ECOS Air Filtering Zeolite paint. I would like a 0 VolatileOrganicCompound concrete floor with perhaps a 0 VolatileOrganicCompound ~H2O Water concrete polish such as RetroPlate. I am a bit of a perfectionist, and am interested in discussing each and every component so that I am satisfied with the outcome of this construction project. I might move in around 90 days after construction completion and request a small construction team wearing fragrance-free clothing and avoiding smoking cigarettes e.g.

In each room, 1 thick soundproof large fixed single pane 6'x6' centered window from 2' to 8' height and 3' to 9' width with a Minimal White metal frame that leaks 0 external air borne particles through. I probably prefer for the glass panes to block UltraViolet UV [A+]B light. A soundproof precise solid White metal door on the left side of the rear wall, and for all involved doors is important to me. Perhaps the doors can be thick metal sliding embedded in deep grooves in the floor and ceiling. Perhaps each of the 7 work rooms could also feature an 8' by 8' centered ceiling skylight window. With nice exterior top to bottom window covering mechanisms for the windows.

For temperature control, I want a high maximum-power unit running quietly on low power, like a recording studio might have. Somewhat far away from the house with the precise location of air inflow optimised. Or, rather than that, perhaps 8 separate nice extremely quiet modern air conditioning heating units: 1 for each building. With air inflow through the center upper portion of the rear wall without a grille over the vents. Each room with a hold option thermostat. That is to say, I want a thermostat which will automatically both trigger the air conditioning function in the heat, and the heating function in the cold, without me having to manually toggle between the 2 modes. As well as an effective quiet On mode rather than Automatic mode so that may help with dehumidifying. I want for this to have highly effective MERV ~18 + C Activated Carbon air filtering and dehumidifying. If possible, a temperature sensor position near the ground not too far from the window and bed, and connection with the internet so that I may change the temperature in a room from my laptop or iPhone SE. We ought to discuss air inflow in bedrooms and outflow in antechambers. No grilles on air vents such that internal air turbulence and fluctuation is minimised. A maximum performance dehumidifier separate from the air conditioner. And perhaps we can discuss truly optimised front doors with robust sealing such that air flow is all mediated via constructed channels.

I want a robust reliable external power generator with automatic backup in the case of a local power outage. I do not want any artificial lighting, but I do want electricity in each room [6 outlets] [all on a side wall far from the window] and aethernetwork interconnected network connection.

Minimal toilets with fully sealed closed lids and sinks without backflows with piping hidden in walls and potentially automatically lowering sealing in-sink-drains. Including the option to push a button and have a 15 minute timed ventilation fan running. We can discuss Minimal Gold coloured metal cylinders or rectangular prisms for many auxiliary elements, such as door handles, toilet paper covering implements, sink pipes, and handles. I want to ensure that the sinks are ~Low-VolatileOrganicCompound when wet but without being wiped down so perhaps we can discuss stone versus metal construction on those, as well as piping hidden behind the walls.

And a disconnected living|gymnasium|shower room. Perhaps placement of a ~H2O Water heater element near the shower room. And an indoor shower [high performance ~H2O Water filter] with a removable hose, a large nice extremely high throughput pipe, and an automatically sealing drain. Including the option to push a button and have a 15 minute timed ventilation fan running. We can discuss Minimal Gold coloured metal cylinders or rectangular prisms for many auxiliary elements, such as door handles, sink pipes and handles, glass shower door handles, etc. Very large glass tiles for the shower interior and a glass door. Shower with a single handholdable high ~H2O Water throughput metal showerhead. I would strongly prefer for there to be 0 Silver coloured metal elements in the house so this implies I would prefer e.g. a Gold coloured Minimal toilet flushing bar element if at all possible as well as a purely Gold or White or Black coloured Minimal refrigerator in the living room etc. And a home gymnasium room there too. Living room: [roughly 24'x24'x10'] with a Minimal sink without backflow [high performance ~H2O Water filter] and electricity for a fridge|freezer and outdoors electric grill. All under a solid extended overhanging cover covering a ~patio of flat concrete probably.

I have attached a sketch of a potential property layout. Minimal interior hand operated door locks with exterior numerical touchscreen keypads. And a tall highly soundproof stone wall surrounding the property including a gate. Truly opaque to external visual investigation and 12' high. An esthetic point of reference is attached. I want a 枯山水 rock garden rather than grass for the inner house wall structure and possibly the entire exterior lot. I ought to explore options for the rock. Please let me know if you have any questions and an estimate.

Sincerely,

Lazar Ilic
