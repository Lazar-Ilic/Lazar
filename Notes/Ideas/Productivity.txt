	Setup

To maximise productivity, be 引きこもり, leave apartment 0 [every 3 days and meal-prepare if trapped in mediocre lease], work 15 hours per day. Dynamic Range 感性 Absolute Discrimination Threshold 絶対閾と弁別閾 Facts ~ 120dB -20dB [observe car headlights at night on roads ~Southwest Parkway near AMD Advanced Micro Devices from Lost Creek]. I am executing this .txt programme. I use local files and Visual Studio Code|Google Chrome for nearly everything. My files organisation is reflected in my GitHub, I have unshared files locally.

It is critical to record ideas, so that one can review them later. And the grading boost. The transition cost is low, and this habit yields massive upside. By "everything", I really mean everything! I suggest Googling ~ "GOV312 Exam 3 Quizlet" then [ctrl a] [ctrl c] [ctrl v] the 3 most recently published relevant Quizlets into a .txt file. Study this for 1 hour each day for 3 days leading in to the test with the completed review sheet also in a .txt file. This way, maybe obtain an A with a total of < 20 hours of labour. One can sometimes utilise the replace all function in Visual Studio Code and turn a .mobi or .pdf into a .txt file. I pick the best looking file from Library Genesis. Also, I have all my school work saved. Everything is backed up on a Google Drive. Have compute and memory. Save .txt articles and stuff.

Chronic Exposure To Notes
Dramatically improves learning and retention. When solving, many moving parts seem routine.

Brainstorming
Sometimes initial ideas are wrong and seemingly stupid ideas are right.

Drafting Weeks In Advance
Then one has following ideas.

Lists
For the Putnam, I created a list of topics I knew I needed to cover and understand deeply to maximise my expected performance.

Homework Writing
Include task details like "definition X" and "for matrix $A=\begin{bmatrix} 3 & 5 \\ 2 & 4 \end{bmatrix}$ one obtains eigenvectors..." so that later it makes sense as a self-contained document. Or include task statements. No "canonical", "Minimal", "immediate", "trivial", "of course", ... Consider using a comment with "%" for WolframAlpha code. Write down variable names in Python and R function calls like ", sd = 3" even when ", 3" suffices to execute. Save all school work and assignments. Mention opportunities and algorithms for parallelisation even if opting to stick with a single-threaded approach. If indicted for unoriginality, ensure to be original moving forward and honourably take sub-100 homework grades rather than 0s or expulsion.

Reading And Working Through Books
Take notes on definitions, key ideas, and related insights. In relevant folder with homework solutions and textbook .pdf file. Consider completionism: solving all tasks, or reading the first line of the solution and contemplating ... This may be the 2nd best option to Graduate School. Email authors or post on Stack to ask questions. Stick to leading physical descriptions rather than isms|diagnostic strings and ackchyually Reddit.com/R/IAmVerySmart Nerd Sniping "(1S,3aS,3bR,9bS,11aS)-11a-Methyl-2,3,3a,3b,4,5,9b,10,11,11a-decahydro-1H-cyclopenta[a]phenanthrene-1,7-diol"|"E2"|"oestradiol" rather than a casual invocation of "estrogen". Use first names rather than pronouns if averse to "they|them|their". Avoid contractions. Disambiguate|deacronymise acronyms. Use the less ambiguous YYYY-MM-DD date format. Be mentally competent enough to pass oral examination dia|polylogues with University Of Belgrade professors.

https://github.com/Lazar-Ilic/Lazar/blob/main/Notes/Computer%20Science/Algorithms/Graduate%20Record%20Examinations/Graduate%20Record%20Examination%20General.txt

Reading And Working Through Papers
Imagine insights, experiments, paths, and "how would I have thought of that?" type questions. See the bibliography. Email authors or post on Stack to ask questions.

Writing Papers
Record thoughts, tank, followup ideas, generalisations, can this be generalised? Read extant literature. Use keywords and massive list of citations for bibliography. Hack cross references. Line up many long editing sessions prior to submissions. Perhaps consult with friends.

	Habits

Form them. Do homework upon release [navigate URL Uniform Resource Locator across all weeks] and go to class 0. I have a library of .pdf and .txt books and on day 0 of courses, copy all deadlines to calendar, perhaps take notes through the entire textbook, set up templates for all homework assignments including correct titling, and compile all discussions, fora, readings, screenplays|film transcripts in to .txt files. One can often view past course syllabi when planning, have a .txt file of course numbers and details ready for registration opening time, and use a phone call Green button push or dual authentication code once per month on a machine by clicking to remember for 30 days. Over time one might pick up other useful habits from people or insights e.g. renew passport|driver's license before 6 months before expiry...

	Lifestyle

Sleep, exercise, and diet are all important. What makes one person feel good may not make another person feel good. Breakfast and fruits|vegetables are not necessary. Many would benefit from the energy of eating chicken [rotisserie] egg white wheat fettuccine with burrata filling|sour cream|cream cheese, ground grass fed beef, white rice, anything warm, NaCl table salty, maybe a tiny bit ~H2O Watery which will not cause too much bloating. Your mileage may vary with 12|12 hours intermittent fasting. Ensure to eat adequately by once in a while writing down on Calendar.txt to try modulating upwards. Muscle mass and Mg Magnesium relate with carbohydrate glycogen uptake and release. One can start off one's day with instant coffee. A 4|month indoor rowing Half Marathon [10000m For Females] habit can potentially improve memory, cardiovascular strength, venous integrity, sense of wellbeing, baseline hedonic tone. Avoid indoor apartments, especially loud studios. Get a house on >= 2 acres. Consider air outside which will get on skin. Consider month-to-month or 1-6 month leases and strong early termination clauses during house and Trading job searches. For houses, one can get a free real estate agent, send desiderata, view > 30 houses whilst high and dehydrated early in the morning, and pick the one which will be best after 15 hours of optimisation upon moving in. Also consider houses on nice land which can turn in to a land purchase for an IO house on a later non-loaned demolition or remodel and construction. Closely monitour everything very crystal clearly technically and precisely, sounds, smells, certain materials, run air conditioning and heater monitouring sounds and smells, measuring indoor air quality, thermostat sensor location, examine patios, neighbours and neighbouring nearby firms, streets, read and measure 168 hours of exterior sound scores with one's own $100 Sony digital microphone instruments as well as interior at <=25dB for the entire duration of the 168 hours. >=2000 lumens|m^2 of sunlight measured through the IO skylights on to the IO work rooms' floors.

	Indoor Air Quality Maximisation | Background Odour Minimisation

Total Time: ~15 Hours

My standing desk at my parents' house in Lost Creek measured 0.050mg/m^3 total volatile organic compounds on a ~$100 sensor which claims accuracy down to 0.001mg/m^3. And solidly worse in my bedroom pre-hacking. One would imagine 0.010mg/m^3 on such an instrument is feasible for elite biological hackers. Odour particles emanate with various intensities and density curves|latencies of clearance. One ought to feel Minimal impulsion to touch nose, effectively clearing out boogies with ~H2O Water-rinsed fingers perhaps ×2|day. Some would allege that waxing nose hairs might effectively decrease this behaviour to ~0 but is still plausibly unhealthful due to the nontrivial encephalitis risk. Because some would allege nose hairs are chronically malodourous. Others would allege that vibrissae and mucous obviously function to filter or moisturise air, despite this not being an obvious physical truth in a world full of MERV 16 HEPA air filters with UVC Ultra Violet C lamps. This is an odd topic the more I read about UV Ultra Violet A|B lamps because air purifiers and byproducts of Ozone|UVC might be sus' where one might posit that UV Ultra Violet A|B for an IO house bedroom is sharper on the micro biologic chemical level. Or perhaps even better yet is no UV UltraViolet lamps at all. Just streaming sunlight in through windows and examining air flows visually for mould with nice cameras might be adequate with [implicit] dehumidification. When waxing it is OK to use 4 or 5 rounds, 8 or 10 plastic rods designed for this purpose. Insert with hot wax and hold in desired position with a little force for 180s prior to pulling out, also with force. Try to leave ~0 residual wax in nose and use a handheld mirror and direct lighting. Upon even further review, do this 1 rod at a time and examine the nose hairs carefully before inserting and holding the nose with the other free hand. This will actually end up being more effective and thus efficient due to improved removal of hairs. Then finish with tweezers as desired to snag a couple missed hairs. In a relatively low background malodour room environment the odours of orange juice, 14 days old Mattress Pad + Pillow Protector, and mildly uplifting ultrahighdefinition fidelity shaved untoweled poophole prior to toweling odour and "taste" may be prominent or dominant. I find my own body odours to be unpleasant nowadays at any hairs length beyond 0mm. Plucking nose hairs is harmful, unhealthful, and not advisable. Waxing might be harm-reductive here versus tweezers. But encephalitis is not the only risk, one ought to not be surprised if experiencing more asthmatic perceptions 36 months down the line. Malodour can transfer via chains like hand to doorknobs and later back to hands, so ensure to adequately rinse fingers skin. Some split air conditioners take unclean city air inflow and irreparable cracks and pressured air flows via neighbours' kitchens and air. Verify exterior 99% Al Aluminium Foil is blocking malodour particles flowing in by performing exterior malodour throughput testing, both subjective and machine verified. Air out wall paint from apartment while at office. There ought to be 0 feeling gross or sticky when sweating and working out at your home gymnasium because sweat just like evaporates and rubs off on to bedding. Some claim claims about sebum that are measured to be false and misanalyses. If one missed this point I can not help but feel that even in a Left kind of socialised health care system basically people ought to GetGot and die sometimes for missing the point. It would kind of be like if I were the health care secretary or whatever sitting in RFK Junior's chair looking kinda high on coffee or whatever and said some shit like: we try our best to give people health care and yet they just continue to kill themselves softly doing the stoopidest shit so елем there you have it folks. And this is precisely the wrong attitude and would suggest one ought to have more middle class solidarity with people who grew up in much worse conditions and hang out with some Red Roses labour party friendos. Nevertheless, Big Brother Government can not save hoi polloi from their own stoopidity. It would be like if I was on Jubilee looking to gain notoriety I would tell 'em straight up a group of people who deserve to die mid-key are... say we are talking about a graduate student who is funded by the hard working American tax payers and they fail to have a backup copy of their research somehow and lose it. Fuck 'em. Seriously retarded. When I am angry and raging sleep deprived it is trivial to observe these sorts of systemic failures around me and certainly expulsion from uni' there is appropriate. If one gets a job at a trading firm, one ought to seize the opportunity... the firm was not obligated to give it to you. The more closely I study degeneracy and devolution, I come to think centre left isms are appealing over libertarian-left positions especially on drugs. Cocaine, marijuana, ..., vapes [vaporisers], cigarettes ought to be illegal and furthermore the prohibition of ethanol was good. 強くなりたい Tsuyoku naritai. 一生懸命 Isshokenmei. "2nd is the 1st loser." - Enzo Ferrari

One can cover a home residential environment in ~Low-VolatileOrganicCompound 99% Al Aluminium Foil, cover walls, all wall-wall neighbour outlet suboptimal potential throughput joints, paints, doors, laundry machines, seal laundry closets with tape and interior closets storing any cooking equipment maximally, create quasi air seals everywhere including e.g. over toilet piping, hang at some door-floor joints monitouring thermics, weather strip interior closets, and put ~everything inside of sealed ~Low-VolatileOrganicCompound Bisphenol-A-Free Plastic boxes. Apply tape rigourously over cracks and at trim joints. Cover stinky floor from a very low height so as to not breathe in minor NaHCO3 baking soda particles with a thick layer of dry NaHCO3 Baking Soda. Simpler to ~H2O water wipe a relatively low-VolatileOrganicCompound modern vinyl floor especially near the head of a mattress upon the floor. Do property damage, remove things, wipe insecticide and chemicals off of sills, ledges, door frames, trims, wrap interior laundry closet in 99% Al Aluminium Foil, ... I am fairly confident that annoying background odours can cause a loss of "IQ" on the order of 5-10 points for people at the higher end of things.

Thoroughly brush, do not push hard, at angles including vertical bottom to top on the inside and outside, until everything feels nice and smooth. Brush tongue, interior, floor, roof, cheeks, and around mouth exterior with toothpaste. Rinse completely with ~H2O Water. Scrape tongue with teeth. Open mouth 0 during the day. Some people prefer avoiding F- Fluoride in their toothpaste and nose mouth throat brains. And some who enjoy to utilise ~H2O Water or Stabiliser-Free Food Grade ~10% H2O2 Hydrogen Peroxide diluted to ~1% qua mouthwash rinse rather than full on brushing in the morning fasted e.g. also set up a teeth brushing set next to each sink and even in work room as a visual remainder aid if struggling with habit formation and compliance. Think "teeth brushing is critical and healthful so I am obligated by capital R Rationality to do it" repeatedly or something... do not merely solve for the true underlying LTO Life Theoretically Optimal strategy but aspire towards compulsively executing it. I dunno. Memorise papers on the deleterious impact of not brushing and mentally flash around through those papers if one notices oneself failing the habit and think "ugh my brain and heart will fail unless I brush my teeth right now". Imagine it is like snagging a free $100 bill of consumer surplus each time. I use the F- Fluoride version personally and thoroughly spit it out but intend to strongly consider the F- Fluoride free version for my myself|young kiddos and no F- Fluoride at the dentist's office. I have not drunk much American public water since ~2016 and note that many bottled orange juice brands probably contain ~0.20mg/L. The xylitol ingredient listed in the OraNurse unflavoured toothpaste products is itself extremely controversial according to hundreds of papers and posts on this topic. An undidactic story here for the readership: a 285 scorer on the USMLE United States Medical Licensing Examination Step 3 might read tens of papers on the topic and come out a bit confused. The domain expert dentist might read more and know more. If one is concerned about the absorption of F- Fluoride through the mouth during teeth brushing, consider monitouring and pursuing a mixed strategy with low F- Fluoride and F- Fluoride free pastes. ["Fluoride Intake and Salivary Fluoride Retention after Using High-Fluoride Toothpaste Followed by Post-Brushing Water Rinsing and Conventional (1400–1450 ppm) Fluoride Toothpastes Used without Rinsing"]. Ceramic fillings are better than plastic composite. Might be very wise to get those electric tooth brushes which makes noise if pushed too hard to help prevent pushing too hard. I have friends who use glass straws down the throat, avoid sugars for the most part, and use F- Fluoride free toothpaste without needing any dental treatment. If one is extremely tired, teeth brushing without flossing is better than nothing and easier than flossing too. Also, if one is averse to a bathroom [in a hotel say] or sink area, or if one is in an airport, one can easily brush with an empty bottle and a bottle of water by rinsing, spitting, flossing, rinsing, spitting, brushing, rinsing, spitting, wiping face. I am quite confident hand hygiene is overrated compared with oral, food, and air hygiene. I will discuss isopropanol versus fragrance free hand soap with my girl friend re nonlipid enteroviruses. This is ~why we have the Peter Attia podcast text files! Anyways it is weird Doctor Mikhail repeatedly insists some of these issues are not Left or Right because... F- Fluoride was also a big cause area amongst quite a few of my Austinite Left friends who are opposed to it. And anyways this is also why we have Harvard Medical Doctor domain experts one can speak with as a patient, forming a doctor patient relationship. So one can also consider placing a teeth brushing setup and a fragrance-free antiperspirant conspicuously at one's desk in an office setting.

	Trading Notes

It is probably unwise to web log, especially for the sake of notoriety as one might presume Michael Druggan is. Recent violence will stifle and chill people feeling free to free speech. Do not whine about sensory stuff to anyone at one's firm. Hack around things competently and avoid drinking ethanol, eating mediocre food. Ensure to focus upon work and go in to the office at 1AM if needed to do so. If one wants a remote job, apply for one. Otherwise, do not expect a perfect optimised world. When composing files like a Jupyter Notebook it is good to record ChatGPT 5 Professional or Claude or whatever... save your prompts. In mardown cells. As well as interesting outputs and human comments. I am quite annoyed by how casually some traders throw around the word "retarded" to describe anything different from them. Some egotistical bias where they fail to realise someone else might chime in and say: hey buddy, I happen to actually think you are the retard and the remote court reporter, general practitioner, architectural consultant, ... are Cooler Than You. Do not write casually like I recently made a big error in a presentation on introductory statistics uh the reasoning even surrounding say one is computing a Bayes Factor and comparing different lines in a linear regression model with say it was not normal residual but log-normal [or rather one might consider modeling returns as normal and stock prices as log-normal but this assumption being wrong is the centre of much content] or some other distribution or whatever and we are doing some integral uh one would not write: we hypothesise a good underlying model for the situation is linear... but rather something more like: it is computationally convenient yadda yadda yadda Jeffreys prior yadda... because [maximum] likelihood estimation is useful. Because it is not like we really think "line is a good model" when we do not and "all models are wrong". I could give a few examples here of basic sort of interviewish tasks one could expect maybe like from some other notes I took is firstly say we are back in this ongoing protein debate example with nontrivial Beta values and low R^2 values and we are thinking prior to observing data how we might even go about modeling the situation OK so we are considering say an inverted U like formally a merging of 2 half parabolas with the same maximum OK degree 2 polynomials. Now say instead we want to take 2 line segments like a continuous hinge and parametrise a turn curvature in a hyperbola as has been done before to make the first derivative continuous. OK but here like... one could think about previous literature on nootropics or actual intuitions surrounding underlying enzymatics, renal issues, etc. and decide a parabola is OK ish maybe... maybe you can ask your boss and also ask your boss for help sometimes instead of being an underproductive loser. But OK another example would be something like here I am casually making this up as I am about to post it up but say something like, and this is a metaphor: Danica is tasked with predicting purchases of Rainy Comfort Food for the Amazon Whole Foods firm for supply chain purposes and in particular she notes that on big multi-day rain events the purchases peak on the first day of raining and drop thereafter and... she is thinking about modeling the situation maybe she thinks there are say it was 3 major Rainy Comfort Food products and each one separately she thinks might be modelable with a probabilistic refractory period type of model so to do the whole thing she can consider a weighted union of disjoint subcases with ~3 * degrees of freedom overparametrised garbage and fit is going to give some really eh output because that is not actually like intuitively "right" here when a better technique is more standard time series stuff with downsampling and a historic analysis. This is going to lead in to my question of what we do say it was Austin, Texas and there was not an abundance but rather some data on 1-day rain events and not much on multi-day events like how to anticipate what might happen on multi-day events if there is quite a lot of noise in the mixture on the output target predicted variable of interest. Anyways, I will exposit further later.

Setup
Extremely important. I run the Visual Studio Code text editor application [see 00 Settings.json] and compile and output in a Google Colab for C++ and Python or Kaggle for R on a 15.6in 1920x1080 Asus Google ChromeBook. Settings in Visual Studio Code are heavily modified rendering it a Minimal text editor with hover triggering information to appear [sometimes useful].

Books
Guide To Competitive Programming, Erickson, CLRS.

Chronic Exposure to Notes
I like reviewing my .txt files to refresh my memory and think about algorithms and implementations.

Resources
Competitive Programming Algorithms, CodeForces blogs, Codechef discussions, ...

Problem Solving
Project Euler, Code Submission Evaluation System, AtCoder, Facebook Meta Hacker Cup, Google Code Jam. When preparing for X, do the contest X archive.

Reading Solutions
Pick tasks with editorials. Read after some time and implement. Read a lot of solutions files too to learn ideas. Look up unknown things and read further references.

Reading Code
Learn better ways of doing things.

Implementation
Do not be scared, practice, and this will be smooth. Use Notebook and modify it for ease of use. Filter by "accepted" and sort by execution time on AtCoder, CodeForces, ... for performant C++ implementations.

Effective Debugging
Do not just ponder code logic: write print statements! Consider writing a naive implementation, comparing the outputs for variables.

Competing
Competing often makes it less stressful.

"In short, actually trying to figure things out, such that we can achieve the good and avoid the bad — especially in arenas where we have to get it right on the first try."

"... there are two modes of experience: appreciative, and evaluative. Concrete example: let's say you're listening to a piece of music. Are you sinking into it, awash in emotions? You're in the appreciative mode. Are you the mixing engineer, listening to the snare hits to make sure they're consistent? You're in the evaluative mode. Much of sanity, and happiness, consists of finding the right mode for the right moment. The appreciative mode is terrible for debugging your business plan. But the evaluative mode is terrible for having a first date. A lot of capable, intelligent people suffer because they do not have the ability to switch out of the evaluative mode, or even notice that they're in it."

Hi,

I am interested in the construction of an ? Insulated Concrete Form house at [~1.5-10 acres isolated land [almost certainly quiet for at least next ~100 years and unlikely to be snagged in eminent domain] address with perhaps Aquasana Filtered Optim~H2O Water and electricity, ~Dripping Springs, Texas]. I want it to be extremely Low-VolatileOrganicCompound in my judgement and quiet, including 4 pairs of 11'x11'x10' rooms with separate medium or high height air inflows in to the work rooms and temperature controls. I want Low-VolatileOrganicCompound, this includes each and every component. I am uniquely seriously concerned on this specification, and care about it more than looks. A high quality 0 VolatileOrganicCompound monolithic drywall rather than a paper-backed or fibre~SiO2 Glass-backed and 0 VolatileOrganicCompound flat White paint might work. All painted elements in 0 VolatileOrganicCompound [VOC] White ?Smog Armour Air Filtering Zeolite paint. I would like a 0 VolatileOrganicCompound concrete floor with perhaps a 0 VolatileOrganicCompound ~H2O Water concrete polish such as RetroPlate. I am a bit of a perfectionist, and am interested in discussing each and every component so that I am satisfied with the outcome of this construction project. I might move in around 90 days after construction completion and request a small construction team of possibly 1 or 2 people wearing fragrance-free clothing and avoiding smoking cigarettes and even maybe creams or scents in automobiles e.g. Also, we ought to discuss the My "Chemical Free" House web log sections on drywall and consult with Corinne Segura|happy house-owning web loggers. I would like to work with you all only if you are keenly interested in taking on this demanding project. As a matter of fact, I am so interested in perfection I could monitour the build site and even say bring comfortable shoes for a painter to wear so as to not drag stuff on to the floor during painting. I do not know if a new window glass might be annoying. I would prefer if the crew has positively dealt with whiny chemophobic clients before and they were pleased.

In each room, 1 thick soundproof large fixed single pane 5'x5' centred window from 2.5' to 7.5' height and 3' to 8' width with a Minimal White metal frame that leaks 0 external air borne particles through. Each of the 4 work rooms also feature a 5'x5' centred ceiling skylight window. I probably prefer for the ~SiO2 Glass panes to not actually block UltraViolet UV [A+]B light with low-E specifications. So clear glass with a high solar heat gain coefficient might work. A soundproof precise solid White metal door on the left side of the rear wall, and for all involved doors is important to me. Perhaps the doors can be thick metal sliding embedded in deep grooves in the floor and ceiling. With nice exterior top to bottom window covering mechanisms for the windows.

For temperature control, I might want a high maximum-power unit running quietly on low power, like a recording studio might have. Somewhat far away from the house with the precise location of air inflow optimised. Or, rather than that, perhaps 5 separate nice extremely quiet modern air conditioning heating units: 1 for each building. It might be wise to produce an elevated outdoor ventilator air in and out flow such that malodour in the inflow is minimised and also elevated CO2 Carbon Dioxide or CO Carbon Monoxide risks indoors are minimised. With air inflow through the center upper portion of the rear wall without a grille over the vents. Each room with a hold option thermostat. That is to say, I want a thermostat which will automatically both trigger the air conditioning function in the heat, and the heating function in the cold, without me having to manually toggle between the 2 modes. As well as an effective quiet On mode rather than Automatic mode so that may help with dehumidifying. Like an automatic ventilation mode with implicit dehumidification. Perhaps we can have the heating wired up as minimal glass panels and also implement UVC ultra violet C lights somewhere in the air flow scheme. I want for this to have highly effective dehumidifying down to ~30-50% and air filtering MERV-14. If possible, a temperature sensor position near the ground not too far from the window and mattress, and connection with the internet so that I may change the temperature in a room from my laptop or iPhone SE. We ought to discuss air inflow in bedrooms and outflow in antechambers. No grilles on air vents such that internal air turbulence and fluctuation is minimised. A maximum performance dehumidifier separate from the air conditioner. And perhaps we can discuss truly optimised front doors with robust sealing such that air flow is all mediated via constructed channels.

I want a robust reliable external power generator with automatic backup in the case of a local power outage. I do not want any artificial lighting, but I do want electricity in each room [6 outlets] [all on a side wall far from the window] and aethernetwork interconnected network connection.

Minimal toilets with fully sealed closed lids and sinks without backflows with piping hidden in walls and lowering sealing in-sink-drains. The sinks could have a relatively high spout and be large enough for head washing [convenient too if I could stand on a stool and rinse off my e.g. upper legs too maybe depending on how large the sink is and configurations]. Including the option to push a button and have a 15 minute timed ventilation fan running. We can discuss Minimal Gold coloured metal cylinders or rectangular prisms for many auxiliary elements, such as door handles, toilet paper covering implements, sink pipes, and handles. I want to ensure that the sinks are ~Low-VolatileOrganicCompound when wet but without being wiped down so perhaps we can discuss stone versus metal construction on those, as well as piping hidden behind the walls. Perhaps have the toilet lid automatically close and the bathroom ventilation fan automatically turn on every use.

And a disconnected kitchen|living|shower room. Perhaps placement of a ~H2O Water heater element near the shower room. And an indoor shower [high performance ~H2O Water filter] with a removable hose, a large nice extremely high throughput pipe, and an automatically sealing drain. Including the option to push a button and have a 15 minute timed ventilation fan running. We can discuss Minimal Gold coloured metal cylinders or rectangular prisms for many auxiliary elements, such as door handles, sink pipes and handles, ~SiO2 Glass shower door handles, ... Very large ~SiO2 Glass tiles for the shower interior and a ~SiO2 Glass door. Shower with a single handholdable high ~H2O Water throughput metal showerhead. I would strongly prefer for there to be 0 Silver coloured metal elements in the house so this implies I would prefer e.g. a Gold coloured Minimal toilet flushing bar element if at all possible as well as a purely Gold or White or Black coloured Minimal refrigerator in the kitchen... Living room: [roughly 24'x18'x10'] with a Minimal sink without backflow [high performance ~H2O Water filter] and electricity for a fridge|freezer and outdoors electric grill. Rather, enough coverage and electricity to support a medium sized outdoors patio kitchen even for a rainy day. All under a solid extended overhanging cover covering a ~patio of flat bright white concrete probably.

I have attached a sketch of a potential property layout. Minimal interior hand operated door locks with exterior numerical touchscreen keypads. [And a tall highly soundproof concrete|stone wall surrounding the property including a gate. Truly opaque to external visual investigation and 8' high. An aesthetic point of reference is attached. I want a 枯山水 rock garden rather than grass for the inner house wall structure and possibly the entire exterior lot. [Upon further review it might be wiser to place some nice stones near the air inflow points and think about the cost associated with minimum distance between grass and such points.]] I ought to explore options for the rock. Please let me know if you have any questions and an estimate.

Sincerely,

Lazar Ilic
