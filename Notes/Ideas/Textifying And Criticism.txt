Reviewing through my private copyrighted local 538 Riddler Official Solutions.txt file got me thinking that I ought to compose a customisable C program to preprocess most .txt files. Here, I will draft some potential steps. This document has since been superceded by the usual NLP Natural Language Processing notes.

Perhaps I ought to not sneer so much in public but a recent post from Eric Topol seemed lousy to me. I am not going to defend Peter Attia on everything and in my own consulting I advise that 0.7 or 0.8 grams of protein per pound of body weight is fine. But the post Our Preoccupation With Protein Intake was very weak for multiple reasons. My first quick thought is that the embedded Tweet from Nassim Nicholas Taleb was retarded. Cows are cows and humans are humans. What is his point here? If he is trying to make one, it is not clear to me nor is it even flowing like a reasoned argument. Another point of contention is the graph from the meta analysis. He is strawmanning I mean they might have hypothesised in advance of looking at the results that an inverted parabola or U shape or maybe a continuous hinge is an OK model for the situation. And then each of those have 3 free parameters or 4 in the latter case if you enable both lines to have nonzero slopes. And so one can just run the numbers and find the pdf partial density function over the possible sets of parameters and maybe see that the vast majority of the probability mass in the hinge where the second line must be constant or have a slight negative slope would have the hinge itself happening at an x-value around 1.61 or whatever. It is not really an illusion or myth if they had intended to run this sort of model in advance of even plotting out the points. And it is a meta analysis so supposedly the right hand part with 10 or 12 points is not overfitting I mean on the underlying usual normal residual assumption which here is sus'. Not a great quality post and also Peter is sometimes weak on this point I feel shilling for his product so in my books this is starting to turn in to yet another debate where all parties are losing and not looking steel.

People tell me all the time that my Resume is awful. Whatever. I ignore them. Anyways, time to criticise the fellow Gokul Gowri:

I am a Tayebati Fellow at MIT, hosted by Stephen Bates (LIDS) and Jonathan Weissman (Whitehead Institute). Recently, I've been learning about the beautiful process of mammalian development -- and building statistical + computational tools to help model it.

My papers can be found on scholar. I like writing code, and share my work on github and through pip. Here is a short c.v..

Some of my other interests are watching WNBA, making playlists on Tidal, and running/biking to olive garden.

I am miffed by how he capitalised WNBA and Tidal but not Olive Garden. This sort of incongruity riles me up. And I am being totally serious when I write: if I could make $200000|year casually as a court reporters' proofreader, I would strongly consider doing so. Especially if one is kind of lazy and can snag over a hunnid bandz straight out of high school.
