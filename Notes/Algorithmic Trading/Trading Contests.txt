There exist many for undergraduates but the most important are probably the firms' with prize pools like Citadel Datathon Data Open and Optiver Ready Trader Go e.g. I think Citadel Datathon Data Open can Black list reject one even if one is a perfect scoring PhD in Statistics but Optiver is semi-open and one probably ought to Win Rank 1 upon that contest. Not doing Optiver Ready Trader Go 2023 is certainly one of my biggest regrets etc. and missing SIG Trader Internship 2019 due to medical health reasons obviously hit my labour market valuation terribly negatively. I hopped in the mixture on the Optiver - Trading At The Close 2023 Kaggle contest. I will hop in to these mixtures more often until, and even after, I sign for Trader.
