Is there no longer a way to share my prediction in a comment? Since last year's competition, I have worked on writing as well as prediction markets. In this task, I thought the high volume over at Kalshi and other books suggested 56% on New York Knicks and 44% on San Antonio Spurs was an OK edge on the market over here. Sometimes one might even think Metaculus or markets with play-money can have an edge due to an extensive literature now extant on issues with money market structures and incentives, but not here with such high volume and low time to expiry on money markets.

There never was a way to automatically do that in multiple choice questions. We haven't figured out an elegant way yet.

Yeah, I doubt we could beat markets in sports. High-volume markets on topics where markets have a long tradition will probably outperform Metaculus, especially when we're talking about questions that are not associated with any prize.

@skmmcj I have seen Market Prices Are Not Probabilities by Quantian's Newsletter, Don't Interpret Prediction Market Prices as Probabilities by bob, and Don't Trust the Political Prediction Markets by Time Magazine, as well as quite a few others.
