Interesting. My first competition on Metaculus. One ought to read resolution criteria closely or else lose $100 easily over stupid misreads. I might hop in the mixture more out of competition as well and comment. The first market which resolved was chess candidates tournament prediction and there I discussed some stuff... I was very slow to a major market update jump event and would have captured much more upside if I had instantly tracked to or above market there. Rank 42 out of the gate and in-the-money for $100 would be chill. I ought to not chime in on financial modeling markets until the hidden period is over.

@nxgracezhang Yes. Interesting. I know some casual amateurs such as myself might consider throwing in a few 1% on low markets and 99% on high markets later in the tournament hoping to spike a win off of all aced outcomes, especially if out-of-the-money at that point in time. I would agree with you on this market being probably mispriced, however I ought to think more about whether or not edges I perceive are substantive.

What will be the combined number of drawn matches in the last four rounds of the Open and Women's 2024 Candidates Tournaments?

@nxgracezhang Sure. I am relatively new to modeling. I also considered trying to see if computer analysis of each player's previous few matches would be useful e.g. to detect if their ELO is not in line with their most recent play level. If I was asked in an interview... I would maybe simply use the last ~5 years of elite tournaments with ELO Delta and previous match [+ colour] of the pair, if separating on male and female perhaps ensuring hundreds or low thousands of matches in the dataset.

Dan Tilkin's model is naive. Examining ELO differences as well as raw ELOs of the scheduled matches is somewhat useful, as is incorporating the direct results of the previous rounds. One might discover in a larger data set on similar tournaments amongst elite players that for example a Win or Loss is much more likely to be followed by a Draw in pair than a Draw so if the remaining matches mostly had Wins or Losses in match 1 of 2 then our posterior distribution might be more Draw heavy. My model had significantly higher credence on low Draw outcomes here prior to round 11 than the consensus.

Further Retroactive Analysis: The scoring mechanism is interesting. Quite a few people might feel incentivised to chime in during the hidden period even if they only feel they have a medium edge. I ought to never again do financial modeling tasks until I am experienced, as others will have me beat there. I misread the Arctic Antarctic task link so I took a brutal unforced error loss there, and one can easily lose $200 in 1 trade on this website game.

So I almost certainly messed up that financial modeling market as well as the Antarctic Arctic one. I should have updated on the visuals of the horse racing track the night before due to wetness as well as the times on the races during the day with respect to previous years. Comments were actually half sharp there pinning times a little on the higher end maybe. I snagged a couple points on that tornadoes task by paying attention to the market and the nearly logical force there and also probably on OpenAI task as well just by paying attention. It would seem as though my intuition on fish salmon at Bonneville Dam might be sharp too based around various reads on the situation. I should have realised the scoring mechanism on distributions is based around probability mass and tightened up my interval on the salmon task. 25% and 75% mean it! I would have been pretty surprised if it was below 2900... I think uh... 5000... could have tightened a spread to more like 3300 and 4700 or something maybe. In an interview we might talk about simple Bayesian models here based around the last 10 years of data maybe simple uh suggest the mean date, peak height, and standard deviation are all drawn from meta normals and then produce distributions for those normals and posteriors uh assuming like each day also has a noisy factor multiplicative normal maybe mean 1 some kind of noise multiplier and then try fitting on to the curvature leading in to produce estimation bounds I dunno why the  market went so low here would think now uh rationalisation but maybe 3100 4500 is not unreasonable... dunno 3300 4700 fishy fish salmon market.

The market just resolved to 3861.42857143. I liked this task quite a lot and wish I had locked in some cool Bayesian Modeling codes on my public GitHub page to produce a stronger posterior more like 3300 4700 bounds eyeballing. Interesting enough. One might think the 10 year average graph is a good reference point as a kind of vague starting prior [one can look at the distribution of the May 1 to May 7 sums for the past 15 or 20 years if one has access to that granularity of data] and one could think about maybe even trying a model where each year is something like a shifted scaled version of the 15 year average with some noise rather than using normals here as I am annotating in other notes. I will read more on solving for an underlying shape given ~15 years of data. Certain mixtures of normal might be normal and binomials and Gamma as well might produce mixtures inside the distribution family. But in general perhaps a sharper technique here if we want to try modeling that way is to take each of the past 15 years and shift them to have the peak on the same x-value and then scale them to have the same peak y-value and then from there take the average of those 15 as a much sharper kind of general shape with which to remodel hyperparameters though there exist other techniques.

edited by Lazar on May 9, 2024, 6:46 PM

So that seems like a powerful technique in general maybe constantly updating through a uh Bayesian model where the underlying distribution is a uh shifted scaled version of the distribution produced by the average of the previous n years or solving for a shape approximator with some noise. Seems OK maybe. For some hard to model curve of the underlying actual natural causal structure with enough data points in our data set. To note here.

I made a typing manual entry error on the UEFA Champions League task by the way... had Real Madrid modeled as having maybe slight edges in the betting markets which was my main source but actually could have scored much more because initially I switched up swapped the 2 lowest P probability outcomes so I need to always ensure to type flawlessly and shieeet like.

Later realised it is stronger to simply sing Fly On The Wall.

Explaining some more of these centaur decisions in a Citadel Securities interview e.g. would be like ugh I must have misunderstood how heavily to update on the market reveal after the hidden period and also must have on RUBRIK I totally botched my algorithm when I was reading news clips and then they changed the named price for the IPO Initial Public Offering my model overly shifted down there at that moment in time. And for salmon I must have misunderstood the value of actually using hard statistics to produce some more reasonable values like a 3300 4700 interval for next year or whatever it comes out to.

This is an interesting enough task to ask people about maybe if we have some data and it is like the sum of multiple distributions over multiple years... maybe the underlying shape is usually like a normal but the precise date is more like Poisson or something so we need to think about underlying causal processes like maybe uh here uh the salmon are "scheduled" to arrive April 28th via some force outside of our knowledge except there are like a few separate factors that can hit it back but like a peak with right shifted off mass can be the underlying could be normal which is why we need to examine the 15 years separately if possible and when doing a shift and scale to produce an average shape need to ensure that it looks sort of kind of OK nothing too deviant in the mixture and can even maybe fudge around a few shift factors if needed.

@RyanBeck Perhaps you all could implement more ways to draw a distribution like a simple sketch with automatic rounding, a sequence of points which defines a trapezoidal split, or a bucketed mechanism via which users shift around buckets up and down and then rescaling. Also, automatic leaderboard updating.

Frankly the current scoring mechanism here kind of does incentivise some degree of 1 99 splitting behaviour early on as well as potentially some strategies based around having multi accounts tossing in 1s and 99s on markets you actually kind of want primary just tracking the market on... to generate stable profit or something like that I am shocked by how rando's with trash submissions led to positive scores for me on markets where I was even a little off on the wrong edge perhaps off the main line of the market under different logarithmic aggregation rules.

Ugh I actually misread the scoring mechanism technically is on a 0.001 to 0.999 ugh did not realise it was not 0.01 to 0.99 and so on and so on ugh. Still seems aight to just pin to 0.01 and 0.99 much of the time ugh not sure not sure not sure the capture e.g. on that Kyle market going from 10 initially down to 4 and the uh 45 points capture there or whatever ugh... clearly market overestimated early on would think on prior and ugh most Kyles from 2023 would not travel far again like... not sure... would want to run numbers on site views from the previous edition and so on and so on who cares in Austin region and Texas.

This was 1 of the 1% 0.01 markets I did opt to go in on as I felt a mispriced edge in that direction. I only did a few and e.g. did not take on risk in the canceled flights market because I was quite unsure on that one... not identifying any substantive informational edge.
"

Perhaps I ought to walk through some more reasonings here in public ugh for the SIG Susquehanna International Group firm et al. ugh... Kyle seemed obviously low to me during the hidden period. Future was clearly undervalued the entire time. See my Like That Remixture.

OKOKOK upon further review I think in the future the strategy would include not extremising... actually just sticking to the market in case others are extremising might look OK... like binary tasks maybe uh really depending... only do distribution during hidden period if have some OK model like maybe for the task on layoffs multiple years running with some kind of sharp variance modeling as well. Think uh extremising is unwise and if extremising expecting market to eventually tank in to 0.001 or something maybe can still precompute a fixed threshold of like 0.01 or 0.02 or something to cut losses ugh... not sure uh... not sure we are ever incentivised to go too extreme. Think just slight edges on the market is wiser in many situations or here if reading comments and feeling a deep edge on market like severely mispricing Nayvadius there on Taylor Swift curvatures of streaming numbers especially following the Kendrick Lamar beef.

@v I wonder how well people could have done with the strategy of "blindly copy the community prediction as soon as it is revealed, and update every day".

Wonder no more! The answer is 861.9 points (rank 40 on the open leaderboard). (Updating instantaneously with changes to the community prediction instead of daily.)

This was calculated based on data in the CSVs that can be downloaded through the “Download CSV” link in the ellipsis menu in the top right of each question page (thanks to @LukeAdmin for pointing them out to me). I actually used the questions and download_csv API endpoints to download the data, but with 47 questions it's feasible to do this manually instead. (The conditional question with ID 22429 requires special processing; retrieve IDs 22430 and 22431 for the subquestions.)

So this is interesting enough if I do hop in to future rounds and think the community is also engaged in some mixed strategy extremising due to behaviour around the money threshold I could probably profit by just hopping in the mixture and community-tracking along on many markets. And also it is nearly a theorem that paying close attention to Metaculus community predictions is a wise idea.

Update on 2024-06-19 after further reflection: I am focusing on financial modeling and maths and physics research. I would think that frankly I undervalued Nayvadius during some nontrivial period and overly updated on the market there... perhaps when I saw the market putting Taylor Swift at 99% I should have just realised the market there was kind of wonky and updated less to it. I do not think I had a substantive edge there on sports betting markets for Real Madrid but honestly could have tried tightly tracking to sports betting market aggregates rather than the underlying Metaculus as a form of arbitrage maybe maybe like would think Metaculus is wronger there than the real money markets. I could maybe have gone a little bit lower on Planet Of The Apes maybe. Not sure. Seems OK. Kyle was solid. I am glad that I snagged free points on OpenAI the moment it hit negative in the public written records weeks out from resolution.

Update on 2024-07-08 upon even further reflection: if I was drilled in an interview on this topic... I would confess that I ought to have run more backtesting during the round to see if maybe or maybe not there does or does not plausibly exist any sort of edge here siphoning information off from sports betting markets to Metaculus. Perhaps sports betting markets update rapidly within an hour or less after matches and Metaculus is slower to update to the proper underlying credence. So one can profit by simply copy and pasting from sports betting markets to Metaculus while other users on Metaculus are snoozing or some such thing. I feel as though a nadir credence of around 0.1 on Nayvadius may have been reasonable enough there uh... not sure mapping out Taylor Swift's expected trajectory and running simulations off of her album streams... not sure not sure not sure. I was not tightly monitouring released figures on Like That or the Like That Kanye Omari West remixture or whatever to predict the impact of the Aubrey Drake Graham versus Kendrick Lamar beef. Funny I commented on Astral Codex Ten with the link to that Drake article. I should really maybe consider updating on the Hudson River Trading firm lingo and rhetoric or whatever surrounding the saturation of their "hypercube" and post up some notes on mid-frequency trading strategies... make some casual observations or hypotheses or whatever.
