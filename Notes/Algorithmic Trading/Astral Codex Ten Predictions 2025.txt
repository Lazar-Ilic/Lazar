Most of the questions in the 2025 Astral Codex Ten competition are mediocre. Some have issues with clarity over resolution criteria. This one, however, is quite interesting to me. I read some documents and cast my prediction. Thanks to the organisers for running and funding the contest.

@skmmcj You might be wrong. The idea of "Will any rationalist, effective altruist, or AI safety researcher go on the Joe Rogan Experience before 2026?" is OK but the operationalisation is tantamount to betting on the interpretation of the resolution council, which is less desirable here than a more formal definition or maybe not having this task.
