Perhaps these notes will help... I strongly advise following through The Economist and Bloomberg history along with memorising standard mainstream logical sequents contained therein with respect to ideas about underlying volatility in price movements etc.

### üíå¬†An introduction

Helloooo, it‚Äôs Sarah aka [@milksandmatcha](https://www.tiktok.com/@milksandmatcha) on TikTok. Recently, a lot of people have been asking me about resources and ‚Äúhow to break into trading‚Äù so I decided to compile what I‚Äôve used into a notion page. This is the **second** and longer version of that resource! **If you‚Äôre interested in past or upcoming guides, be sure to follow my [TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/@milksandmatcha) where I announce/share them.**

- this is all based on my own experiences but hopefully, you find it somewhat helpful
- it‚Äôs not 100% comprehensive so if you know of anything not mentioned, definitely shoot me a [**DM on TikTok**](https://www.tiktok.com/@milksandmatcha) and I‚Äôd love to add it :)

Most of these books and textbooks you can find for free online, although I‚Äôm not going to link them. 

### üíå¬† General Textbooks
