Dear Participants,

Thank you for your interest and enthusiasm in participating in Algothon. We appreciate the time and effort you have put into preparing for this competition.

However, we regret to inform you that, according to the competition rules, participation is restricted to individuals residing in Australia and New Zealand. As you are located outside of this region, we must unfortunately disqualify your registration.

We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause and understand that this news may be disappointing. We value your interest in Algothon and encourage you to stay tuned for future opportunities that may include a broader participant base.

Thank you for your understanding and support.

Best regards,

Jay Jargal

Hi,

Sorry. It must have been a technical misunderstanding on my part. I hope you all have fun and rebalance teams as desired.

Sincerely,

Lazar Ilic
