Interesting stuff showed up in my advertisements review. "Devoid Of Ideology". Looks quite high in production value. I saw on LinkedIn financial news skimming that podcasting is now a bigger business than ever before. And my mum actually enjoys some of those. I dunno reflecting on my father being entertained by The Great Courses... I dunno dunno dunno always prefer .txt files but might show my kiddos these various modalities of entertainment... also take them to a cinema 1 time probably. Think probably Peter Attia MD and Doctor Jordan Peterson could have spot checked me on multiple suboptimalities in my own lifestyle hacking and Productivity.txt file if they had opted in to providing written pro bono feedback or whatever. So it is interesting I get these when I am doing advertising reviews and want to torrent extract... because he decided with his executive production team to be in the Whiteroom Matrix Construct! Yay! One of my favourite memes of all time thus far is Morpheus appearing in the Whiteroom with Neo so now Jordan gives his funny little talks from a Greenscreen or whatever. I think many comedy rappers have too inadvertently or whatever think Kanye Omari West in Love Lockdown American Psycho or Aubrey Drake Graham in Energy. Funny. "The Matrix is real." - Andrew Tate. I saw Professor Wasalu Muhammad Jaco recently in front of a Greenscreen maybe not it was a few screens for Cake from ‰æç Samurai.
