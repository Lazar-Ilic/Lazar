Here I will hopefully impress some firms with OK quality ideation relating to mid-frequency trading given that I do not have huge datasets to work on in HFT High Frequency Trading.

----------

Volume of activity on Twitter, volume of activity on American Twitter, volume of activity on elite American media Twitter, volume of Tweets on the topic of Apple products, volume of news clips and commentary on Elon Musk, ... I ought to think more perhaps about simple ish equities... stocks... uh I dunno if a firm like Hudson River Trading would assign me to some mid-frequency desk doing stocks mostly. Just uh unclear right now if I really do even have the talent, gift, potential to do the right kind of thinking and ideation here for developing novel datasets to use in mid-frequency stock trading. I intend to hop in the mixture reading more books and maybe doing the Berkeley contest if they will have me. Who Will Survive In America?
