Tricky to even implement some kind of attempt to generate a half decent starting approximation for n = 20 for 20^2/4 to 20^2/2 = 100 to 200 type of lengths. Because even checking the number of permutations hit is extremely nontrivial at [100 choose 20] types of lengths. Seems possible if the next value like 21 or 22 or 23 maybe to uh do discovery here... uh maybe that would be tricky uh... perhaps I can try to manually construct something here and hit anything nontrivially beneath the current n^2/2 upper bound or whatever. OKOKOK time to keep my own ideation private.
