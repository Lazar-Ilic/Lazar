Interesting related tasks.

It is funny enough if there is a sharper algorithm for relatively sparse graphs like say we want the maximum chain through ECLAIRE in the French Scrabble words list where swapping a letter or dropping or adding is allowed. In an interview setting one might expect the interviewer would be looking for something like a uh bridges and connected components break down followed up with a cycle in that vertex's component minus 1 edge and then a uh dynamic program directed acyclic graph to maximise outwards on 2 paths from there or not really uh maybe at that point uh bridges and broken components are not ensured to have an actual maximal cycle through them so at this point it is not really that trivial. Maybe it is trivial. I do not know and am tired frustrated now with my mental status need to grind on finance perhaps. Articulation points here is still tricky tricky tricky.
