Interesting enough paper floated across my monitour the other day and I could not help but think... say we have n dudes on an nxn board and want to evaluate the performance of a configuration of dudes... we could simply try the following algorithm: penalty score comes from taking the minimal rectangles which fully enclose the desired subsets and adding up for each rectangle the number of wrong dudes inside the rectangle. OK then the algorithm is as follows: start off evaluating a tonne of random boards. Then from the minimum penalty board basically do like a uh nearby similar dudes and maybe even some random dudes that are sort of close but not too similar with RNG to get us over any weird local minima perhaps. Maybe this randomised algorithm will perform quite well in many real life instances at the n=20 to n=50 range... or even n=100 range... not sure computationally seems quite viable.
