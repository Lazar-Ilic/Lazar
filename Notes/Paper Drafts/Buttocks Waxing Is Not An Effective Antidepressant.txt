Drafting up my 2024 Ig Nobel Prize submission.

Maybe in the future what we do is run experimentation on undergraduates or graduate students like get some kiddos in to the laboratory and ask if they have not played billiards regularly we measure their performances on 100 lags and then see how tightly correlated performance here is with future prognostics of neurologic conditions.

Trolling further would be like mang I read so many papers on cilia, memory, some weird ones, think on the brain organ cilia not body hairs but like if I had funding we could run it up discover even would be interesting if 10% of undergraduate males got a non trivial mood boost from full body waxing only to reveal maybe what caused the boost was that my laboratory hired a cute girl to do the waxing on the study participants or whatever and shit like this.

What fraction of undergraduate males and females regularly wax their bodies?
ChatGPT said:
The fraction of undergraduate males and females who regularly wax their bodies can vary based on cultural norms, geographic location, and personal preferences. However, based on available survey data and studies on grooming habits:

Females: Approximately 30-50% of undergraduate females report regularly waxing some part of their body (such as legs, arms, or bikini area).
Males: Around 5-15% of undergraduate males regularly wax, typically focusing on areas like the chest, back, or eyebrows.
These numbers are general estimates and can fluctuate depending on factors like beauty trends, peer influence, and accessibility to waxing services. Would you like more specific data from a particular region or demographic?
