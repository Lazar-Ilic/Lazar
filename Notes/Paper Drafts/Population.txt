Back to that Elon Musk Tweet on the Idiocracy film and my own ranting about a 2-child policy in 1950 under a hypothetical unipolar global power structure. Global productivity and growth would be unclear, as would be average productivity but one might suppose 2 child families are stronger there over 8 child families. In any case, I digress. Interesting enough to simulate genetics and magnitudes of drifts over time say everyone has 0, 1, or 2 children under some different functions of supposed implicit genes and genetic fitness functions. Then consider expected genetic propagation from each individual etc. etc. the direct literal lineage of genes function and overall aggregate propagation throughout time in a relatively stable population size function or whatever. Implications for "evolutionary psychology" re happiness functions of seeing 7 versus 8 great grand children existing? The Party screenplay also known as The Dictator 9 reveals much. The people who reproduce younger come to spread more. The World would be a much less toxic place if I was the head of the Food and Drugs Administration.
