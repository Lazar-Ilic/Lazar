Apparently time series are very interesting. I might post up some notes on R libraries and Stata fora and other documents relating to how events might impact markets. And how to reason about their effect sizes under the influence of other variables. I need to study this stuff more closely. Especially interesting to me I guess say we believe events have some impact on the price function around the event and we have 1 more free variable and we think maybe it should be concave and monotone increasing effect size at any time t as the parameter increases but that is the only constraint or something and we want to compute like some kind of simple uh the MLE Maximum Likelihood Estimator under some simple assumptions. Where here the MLE should occur near the ~median anyways of the overall distribution.
