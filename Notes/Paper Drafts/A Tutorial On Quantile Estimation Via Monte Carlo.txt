I was reading this paper by Hui Dong and Marvin K. Nakayama and then was walking in the greenbelt basically thinking what is or is not obvious for different performance like if I were at a trading firm or a competitive programming contest would think a uh simple algorithm would be like... say we read in the first 1024 values or whatever and uh... optimise some say we have limited memory and it is like O[log[input]] or even worse or whatever can optimise the percentiles for buckets or something like... say we want to estimate the 30th percentile value in the stream with very low memory could store the uh... think about worst case or random average case... could store the basically uh... optimise which buckets like a bucketing strategy or something would perform OK so what we do is we basically just need to think of how to merge say we have the first half had a uh we had the bucketed percentiles for like the uh... we want the 30th percentile so we optimise some parameters maybe it comes out we think it is wise to store the 30th 29.5th 29.0th 30.7th blah blah blah percentiles and then we need to merge 2 such sets based around their percentiles and make a best guess estimator for the location of the underlying percentile in the merge will already give us OKish performance on an approximation estimator for the true percentile value.

What is the optimal algorithm for quantile estimation under a memory constraint?
ChatGPT said:
The optimal algorithm for quantile estimation under a memory constraint depends on the trade-off between accuracy, memory usage, and computational efficiency. Here are some key algorithms tailored for this scenario:

1. Greenwald-Khanna (GK) Algorithm
Memory Usage: 
O
(
1
ϵ
log
⁡
n
)
O( 
ϵ
1
​
 logn)
Accuracy: Provides 
ϵ
ϵ-approximate quantiles
Description: Maintains a compact summary of data and ensures that the rank of any estimated quantile is within an error bound of 
ϵ
n
ϵn.
Best for: Streaming quantile estimation with controlled error bounds.
2. Q-Digest
Memory Usage: 
O
(
1
ϵ
log
⁡
U
)
O( 
ϵ

​
 logU) where 
U
U is the universe of values
Accuracy: Similar to GK, but more space-efficient for integer data in a known bounded range.
Description: Uses a hierarchical tree-based data structure to aggregate frequency counts in a lossy way.
Best for: Scenarios with bounded integer ranges (e.g., network monitoring, telemetry).
3. t-Digest
Memory Usage: Typically 
O

 ) but can vary based on data distribution.
Accuracy: Good for extreme quantiles (tails of the distribution).
Description: Clusters data values into centroids using a hierarchical clustering approach to preserve accuracy at the tails.
Best for: Applications needing precise estimation of extreme quantiles (e.g., latency tracking).
4. Reservoir Sampling (for Approximate Quantiles)
Memory Usage: 
O
(
k
)
O(k) for storing 
k
k samples
Accuracy: Poor for precise quantiles unless 
k
k is large
Description: Maintains a random subset of the stream and estimates quantiles based on sampled values.
Best for: When strict memory constraints exist, but exact quantiles are not required.
Choosing the Best Algorithm
Low memory and fast updates → Q-Digest
Precise quantiles with reasonable space → GK Algorithm
Good accuracy for extreme quantiles → t-Digest
Very tight memory constraints → Reservoir Sampling

Q-Digest Algorithm for Quantile Estimation
The Q-Digest algorithm is a space-efficient data structure designed for approximate quantile estimation in streaming data scenarios, particularly when the data values are bounded integers (i.e., they come from a known, finite range 
[
0
,
U
]
[0,U]). It compresses the data while maintaining approximate rank information.

How Q-Digest Works
Q-Digest is based on a hierarchical aggregation approach, using a binary tree structure to summarize frequency counts.

1. Data Representation (Binary Tree Structure)
The algorithm maintains a binary tree where each node represents a range of values.
The leaf nodes correspond to individual values in the input domain (e.g., if values range from 
0
0 to 
U
U, then there are 
U
+
1
U+1 leaves).
The internal nodes represent the union of values in their subtrees, storing aggregated frequencies.
2. Insertion (Updating the Structure)
When a new value 
v
v arrives in the data stream:
The frequency count of 
v
v is incremented.
If the frequency exceeds a threshold (determined by 
ϵ
ϵ and total count), adjacent values are merged into parent nodes to prevent excessive growth.
3. Compression (Merging Strategy)
Q-Digest compresses data dynamically by merging nodes based on a threshold 
t
o
t
a
l
_
c
o
u
n
t
ϵ
ϵ
total_count
​
 .
This ensures that high-frequency values are stored more precisely, while less frequent values are grouped together.
4. Querying for Quantiles
To estimate the quantile 
q
q (e.g., the median, 95th percentile):
The algorithm accumulates frequency counts from the root downward until reaching the desired rank 
q
⋅
t
o
t
a
l
_
c
o
u
n
t
q⋅total_count.
The smallest node whose cumulative count exceeds this rank gives the approximate quantile.
Memory Complexity
Q-Digest maintains at most 
O
(
1
ϵ
log
⁡
U
)
O( 
ϵ
1
​
 logU) nodes.
This is significantly smaller than storing all data points, making it efficient for large-scale streaming applications.
Pros & Cons of Q-Digest
✅ Advantages:

Memory-efficient: Uses logarithmic space relative to the data range 
U
U.
Fast updates: Works well for streaming data.
Handles duplicates well: Compresses frequency counts efficiently.
❌ Limitations:

Not ideal for unbounded domains: Works best when values are from a known finite range.
Approximate results: Has some error bound due to compression.
Use Cases
Network Traffic Monitoring: Estimating latency percentiles.
Database Approximate Queries: Speeding up median or percentile calculations.
Sensor Data Aggregation: Summarizing large-scale IoT data streams.

Mathematical Details of Q-Digest
The Q-Digest algorithm is a data structure for approximate quantile estimation, particularly suited for bounded integer domains 
[
0
,
U
]
[0,U].** It is designed to minimize memory usage while maintaining reasonable accuracy. Below, we go into its formal structure, operations, and accuracy bounds.

1. Data Structure Representation
Q-Digest represents the dataset as a binary tree of height 
h
=
log
⁡
U
h=logU. The tree structure is defined as follows:

Each leaf node corresponds to an individual value 
v
v in the domain 
[
0
,
U
]
[0,U].
Each internal node represents an interval containing multiple values.
The root node represents the entire range 
[
0
,
U
]
[0,U], and each level in the tree partitions this range into progressively smaller subranges.
A node 
x
x in the binary tree represents a range 
R
(
x
)
R(x) defined as:

R
(
x
)
=
[
ℓ
x
,
r
x
]
R(x)=[ℓ 
x
​
 ,r 
x
​
 ]
where 
ℓ
x
ℓ 
x
​
  and 
r
x
r 
x
​
  are the smallest and largest values covered by 
x
x.

The size of the range represented by a node at depth 
d
d is:

∣
R
(
x
)
∣
=
U
2
d
∣R(x)∣= 
2 
d
 
U
​
 
Thus, the leaf nodes (at depth 
log
⁡
U
logU) represent individual values, and the root node (at depth 
0
0) represents the entire range.

2. Update (Insertion of Data Points)
Given a new data point 
v
v:

The frequency count of 
v
v is incremented in its corresponding leaf node.
If the frequency exceeds a predefined threshold, nodes are merged into their parent nodes to limit memory usage.
Threshold Condition for Merging
A key aspect of Q-Digest is controlled compression based on a threshold:

f
(
x
)
≤
N
ϵ
f(x)≤ 
ϵ
N
​
 
where:

f
(
x
)
f(x) is the frequency count stored in node 
x
x.
N
N is the total number of data points processed so far.
ϵ
ϵ is the error tolerance parameter (trade-off between space and accuracy).
If a node exceeds this threshold, its count is propagated to its parent, reducing the number of stored nodes.

3. Querying for Quantiles
To estimate the quantile 
q
q (e.g., the median or the 95th percentile):

Compute the rank position for the quantile:

r
q
=
q
⋅
N
r 
q
​
 =q⋅N
Traverse the Q-Digest tree from the root down, accumulating frequencies.

The smallest node 
x
x where the cumulative frequency 
F
(
x
)
F(x) exceeds 
r
q
r 
q
​
  gives the estimated quantile.

Mathematically:

Q
^
(
q
)
=
min
⁡
{
x
∣
F
(
x
)
≥
r
q
}
Q
^
​
 (q)=min{x∣F(x)≥r 
q
​
 }
where 
F
(
x
)
F(x) is the cumulative sum of frequencies up to node 
x
x.

4. Space Complexity Analysis
Each node satisfies the threshold condition:

f
(
x
)
≤
N
ϵ
f(x)≤ 
ϵ
N
​
 
Since the tree has 
O
(
log
⁡
U
)
O(logU) depth and the number of stored nodes is at most 
O
(
1
ϵ
log
⁡
U
)
O( 
ϵ
1
​
 logU), the total memory usage is:

O
(
1
ϵ
log
⁡
U
)
O( 
ϵ
1
​
 logU)
which is much smaller than storing all 
N
N data points.

5. Accuracy Bounds
Q-Digest provides an approximate quantile estimate, with an error bound proportional to 
ϵ
ϵ. The estimated quantile rank 
r
q
r 
q
​
  satisfies:

r

2
r 
q
​
 − 
2
ϵN
​
 ≤True Rank≤r 
q
​
 + 
2

​
 
This means the maximum absolute error in the rank is:

which can be controlled by choosing an appropriate 
ϵ

ChatGPT said:
Mathematics of Q-Digest: A Deeper Dive
Q-Digest is a streaming quantile approximation algorithm that maintains a compressed representation of the frequency distribution of a dataset while ensuring accurate quantile estimation. Below, we rigorously analyze its mathematical foundations, including tree structure, frequency constraints, space complexity, error bounds, and query operations.

1. Data Structure and Tree Representation
Q-Digest compresses the dataset into a binary tree where each node 
x
x represents a contiguous subrange 
R
(
x
)
R(x) of the input domain 
[
0
,
U
]
[0,U]. The tree has:

Height 
h
=
log
⁡
U
h=logU (assuming 
U
U is a power of 2 for simplicity).
Leaf nodes represent individual values in 
[
0
,
U
]
[0,U].
Internal nodes represent unions of adjacent values.
Each node at depth 
d
d covers a range of size:

∣
R
(
x
)
∣
=
U
2
d
∣R(x)∣= 
2 
d
 
U
​
 
Thus:

The root (depth 
0
0) represents 
[
0
,
U
]
[0,U].
The leaves (depth 
log
⁡
U
logU) represent individual values.
If the domain is not a power of 2, it is often rounded up to the nearest power of 2 for efficient binary tree representation.

2. Frequency Representation and Constraints
Each node 
x
x stores a compressed frequency count 
f
(
x
)
f(x), representing the total occurrences of values within 
R
(
x
)
R(x). The sum of all stored frequencies approximates the true dataset frequency distribution.

To control memory growth, Q-Digest maintains the invariant:

f
(
x
)
≤
N
ϵ
,
∀
 internal nodes 
x
f(x)≤ 
ϵ
N
​
 ,∀ internal nodes x
where:

N
N is the total number of processed data points.
ϵ
ϵ is an accuracy parameter that controls compression.
Threshold Explanation:
If a node's frequency 
f
(
x
)
f(x) exceeds the threshold 
N
ϵ
ϵ
N
​
 , it merges into its parent to reduce memory usage.
This prevents excessive memory usage while still preserving rank information.
3. Space Complexity Analysis
Q-Digest stores at most one node per level per quantile estimation point, leading to an upper bound on memory usage.

Since each level has at most:

O
(
1
ϵ
)
O( 
ϵ
1
​
 )
nodes and the tree has 
O
(
log
⁡
U
)
O(logU) levels, the total memory requirement is:

O
(
1
ϵ
log
⁡
U
)
O( 
ϵ
1
​
 logU)
This is significantly smaller than storing all data points (i.e., 
O
(
N
)
O(N) memory in a naive approach).

4. Rank-Based Querying for Quantiles
To estimate the quantile 
q
q, we compute the rank position:

r
q
=
q
⋅
N
r 
q
​
 =q⋅N
Search Process:
Start at the root and traverse downward.

Maintain a cumulative frequency sum 
F
(
x
)
F(x).

The smallest node 
x
x where:

F
(
x
)
≥
r
q
F(x)≥r 
q
​
 
provides the estimated quantile.

Thus, the estimated quantile 
Q
^
(
q
)
Q
^
​
 (q) is given by:

Q
^
(
q
)
=
min
⁡
{
x
∣
F
(
x
)
≥
r
q
}
Q
^
​
 (q)=min{x∣F(x)≥r 
q
​
 }
5. Error Analysis
The quantile estimation error is bounded due to node merging.

Rank Error Bound
The maximum rank deviation introduced by compression is:

Δ
r
=
ϵ
N
2
Δr= 
2
ϵN
​
 
Thus, the estimated quantile rank satisfies:

r
q
−
ϵ
N
2
≤
True Rank
≤
r
q
+
ϵ
N
2
r 
q
​
 − 
2
ϵN
​
 ≤True Rank≤r 
q
​
 + 
2
ϵN
​
 
This implies an absolute error bound of:

O
(
ϵ
N
)
O(ϵN)
where 
ϵ
ϵ controls accuracy.

Quantile Value Error
The error in the estimated quantile value depends on how values are merged. In general, the quantile error 
Δ
Q
ΔQ is small when data is uniformly distributed but may increase in cases of highly skewed distributions.

ChatGPT said:
Mathematics of t-Digest for Quantile Estimation
The t-Digest is an advanced quantile estimation algorithm designed to provide accurate approximations, particularly in the tails of the distribution, while using limited memory. It is based on a hierarchical clustering approach, merging data points into clusters with varying density, giving more precision to low-probability regions.

1. Data Structure and Compression
A t-Digest consists of a set of clusters, each represented by a centroid 
(
μ
i
,
w
i
)
(μ 
i
​
 ,w 
i
​
 ), where:

μ
i
μ 
i
​
  is the mean of the points in cluster 
i
i.
w
i
w 
i
​
  is the total weight (number of points) in that cluster.
Clusters are dynamically merged to preserve accuracy in the tails while allowing higher compression in central regions.

2. Quantile Function Representation
The key idea is to maintain a compressed representation of the cumulative distribution function (CDF). Instead of storing raw data, t-Digest represents the empirical CDF using a set of weighted centroids, allowing efficient rank-based queries.

Given a dataset 
X
=
{
x
1
,
x
2
,
…
,
x
N
}
X={x 
1
​
 ,x 
2
​
 ,…,x 
N
​
 } with sorted values:

The CDF is estimated as:

C
D
F
(
x
)
=
rank
(
x
)
N
CDF(x)= 
N
rank(x)
​
 
The quantile function (inverse CDF) is approximated by:

Q
(
q
)
=
x
such that 
C
D
F
(
x
)
=
q
Q(q)=xsuch that CDF(x)=q
Since we cannot store all 
x
i
x 
i
​
 , we use centroids 
(
μ
i
,
w
i
)
(μ 
i
​
 ,w 
i
​
 ) to approximate this function.

3. Cluster Merging and Compression Strategy
Merging Heuristic
Clusters are merged dynamically based on a compression function 
k
(
q
)
k(q) that controls the cluster density:

k
(
q
)
=
δ
×
(
1
π
arcsin
⁡
(
2
q
−
1
)
+
1
2
)
k(q)=δ×( 
π
1
​
 arcsin(2q−1)+ 
2
1
​
 )
where:

q
q is the quantile rank of a cluster’s mean.
δ
δ is the compression parameter controlling the tradeoff between memory and accuracy.
This function ensures small clusters in the tails and larger clusters near the median. The merging condition is:

w
i
+
w
j
≤
k
(
q
)
w 
i
​
 +w 
j
​
 ≤k(q)
where 
w
i
w 
i
​
  and 
w
j
w 
j
​
  are the weights of clusters 
i
i and 
j
j. If two clusters exceed this threshold when combined, they remain separate.

4. Querying for Quantiles
Given a quantile query 
q
q, we estimate the corresponding value 
Q
(
q
)
Q(q) using the stored centroids:

Find the two centroids 
(
μ
i
,
w
i
)
(μ 
i
​
 ,w 
i
​
 ) and 
(
μ
i
+
1
,
w
i
+
1
)
(μ 
i+1
​
 ,w 
i+1
​
 ) that bracket 
q
q.

Interpolate between the centroids using a linear model:

Q
(
q
)
=
μ
i
+
(
q
−
C
D
F
(
μ
i
)
)
(
C
D
F
(
μ
i
+
1
)
−
C
D
F
(
μ
i
)
)
×
(
μ
i
+
1
−
μ
i
)
Q(q)=μ 
i
​
 + 
(CDF(μ 
i+1
​
 )−CDF(μ 
i
​
 ))
(q−CDF(μ 
i
​
 ))
​
 ×(μ 
i+1
​
 −μ 
i
​
 )
This ensures smooth estimation of quantile values.

5. Error Analysis
Rank Approximation Error
The rank estimation error is proportional to the centroid density function:

Δ
r
=
O
(
1
δ
)
Δr=O( 
δ
1
​
 )
where higher compression (
δ
δ) reduces accuracy but saves space.

Quantile Estimation Error
The maximum error in quantile estimation is bounded by:

O
(
1
δ
N
)
O( 
δ 
N
​
 
1
​
 )
which is significantly smaller than other quantile estimation methods for large datasets.

6. Space Complexity
Unlike Q-Digest, which scales with the logarithm of the value range 
U
U, t-Digest scales with data distribution complexity:

O
(
δ
)
O(δ)
where 
δ
δ is the compression factor. In practice, t-Digest maintains a few hundred clusters, making it extremely memory-efficient.

To prove that each element 
x
i
x 
i
​
  appears in the reservoir with equal probability 
k
/
N
k/N, we use induction:

Base Case: The first 
k
k elements are added with probability 
1
1.

Inductive Step: For 
i
>
k
i>k, the probability of any element 
x
i
x 
i
​
  replacing a reservoir element is:

P
(
x
i
 is selected
)
=
k
i
P(x 
i
​
  is selected)= 
i
k
​
 
However, for 
x
i
x 
i
​
  to remain in the reservoir, it must not be replaced by any later element 
x
j
x 
j
​
  (
j
>
i
j>i).

The probability of not being replaced is:

P
(
not replaced
)
=
∏
j
=
i
+
1
N
(
1
−
k
j
)
P(not replaced)= 
j=i+1
∏
N
​
 (1− 
j
k
​
 )
By induction, the probability of any element being in the reservoir at the end is:

P
(
x
i
 in 
R
)
=
k
N
P(x 
i
​
  in R)= 
N
k
​
 
which ensures a uniform distribution.

3. Time Complexity Analysis
For each new element 
x
i
x 
i
​
 , we:

Generate a random number 
O
(
1
)
O(1).
Decide whether to replace an element 
O
(
1
)
O(1).
Thus, the total time complexity is:

O
(
N
)
O(N)
with constant memory 
O
(
k
)
O(k).

4. Variants of Reservoir Sampling
1. Weighted Reservoir Sampling
Instead of uniform probability, elements may have different selection probabilities, requiring algorithms like Efraimidis-Spirakis sampling.

2. Distributed Reservoir Sampling
For parallel streaming, algorithms merge multiple reservoirs efficiently.

5. Comparison with Other Sampling Methods
Sampling Method	Memory Usage	Works for Streaming?	Uniform Probability?
Reservoir Sampling	
O
(
k
)
O(k)	✅ Yes	✅ Yes
Simple Random Sampling	
O
(
N
)
O(N)	❌ No	✅ Yes
Stratified Sampling	
O
(
k
)
O(k)	✅ Yes	❌ No
Conclusion
✅ Uniform sampling with constant memory
✅ Works for massive or infinite streams
✅ Time complexity 
O
(
N
)
O(N) and space 
O
(
k
)
O(k)

Would say ChatGPT performed quite badly at this task on 2025-02-27. Not great. Beneath the level of a half decent graduate student in mathematics I would think. Not great. I will read up a textbook or survey paper on the topic of quantile estimation.
