I ought to read up on relevant laws and "ethics". And also possibly consult with the relevant authorities lawyers and local police at the University Of Texas At Austin prior to advertising for my study with posters and running it. Might want to hire someone else more trained to perform the buttocks waxing... also to mitigate against the risk someone like Dr. Etienne Vouga shows up and poo poos defaecates on the buttocks waxer. So in any case, I digress might end up not running this study. But in terms of strong study design I think it is OK to pay the participants $0 and ask them questions like:

Day Of:
Rate Pain On A Scale From 0.0 To 10.0
Rate Subjective Wellbeing

14 Days Later:
Were You Pleasantly Surprised?
Ingrown Hair[s]?
Pain?

Perhaps their mood[s] will alter anyways in accordance with the dates and season and term progression... but in any case running a n0 group would be annoying. 14 days is not too bad. Waxing is not really even that trivial really to study right now for me from the outside in the pro-psychology framework of analysis. OK so I decided to cancel this study pre emptively 2024-08-28. Hairs removal cream given to the study participants would be easier in its own kind of way and less likely to cause ingrown hairs but still kind of gnarly and nasty for some at the time of application. Upon further review ~2024-09-24 I would predict minimal efficacy of this intervention for most relevant outcome metrics.
