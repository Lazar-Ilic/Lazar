Perhaps eventually I will work through all of these slowly and actually try to compile solutions.

Advanced Courses (Depth Requirement)
Students are required to complete a depth requirement consisting of a minimum of three courses (nine units) of advanced topics courses offered by the department. Courses for the depth and breadth (see below) requirements must equal a combined minimum of 24 units. Recommended advanced topics courses include the following:

Introduction to Time Series Analysis (Stats 307)
Information Theory and Statistics (Stats 311)
Advanced Statistical Methods (Stats 314A)
Modern Applied Statistics: Learning (Stats 315A)
Modern Applied Statistics: Learning II (Stats 315B)
Stochastic Processes (Stats 317)
Modern Markov Chains (Stats 318)
Machine Learning Methods for Neural Data Analysis (Stats 320)
Function Estimation in White Noise (Stats 322)
Multivariate Analysis (Stats 325)
Causal Inference (Stats 361)
Monte Carlo (Stats 362)
Design of Experiments (Stats 363)
Bayesian Statistics (Stats 370)
Convex Optimization I (EE 364A)
Convex Optimization II (EE 364B)
In any given year only some of these courses will be offered. These courses are normally taken after the first year and may help students to find dissertation topics.
