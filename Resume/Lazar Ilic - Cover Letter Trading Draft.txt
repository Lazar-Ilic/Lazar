I would love to work with you all.

I have been focusing on computer science and statistics for some time now, and considering a career in trading. It seems fun, stimulating, lucrative. The ArXiV's Statistics Theory section is interesting, as are textbooks like The Elements Of Statistical Learning. Blah blah blah here can mention prior experience. And maybe insinuate you are competitive and enjoy betting and reasoning about mathematical decision making practise.

I read on your firm's website [and gleaned from other posts by your employees and others on the internet] that you all are mostly engaged in market making on equities. Blah blah blah should customise this right here up front reveal I care to half a degree to take a note like something.
